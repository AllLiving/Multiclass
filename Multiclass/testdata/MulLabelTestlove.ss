HIG		this has to be my absolute favorite for special occasions and all other occasions for that matter . <sssss> the wait staff is prompt and professional . <sssss> the food , from beginning to end is overwhelmingly delicious . <sssss> i love it ; the breads , salads , soups , main courses , desserts , wine , drinks . <sssss> it is all so good . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back , hopefully soon . <sssss> a couple of years ago , we saw senator mccain with his wife and 2 other couples there at dinner . <sssss> wonder if we will see a blog from him for vincent 's on yelp.com ... hmm ?

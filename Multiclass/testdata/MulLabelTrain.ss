LOW		we went on a sunday around 11am we got seated right away . <sssss> the menu is trying to be like a new-american style type of menu . <sssss> i ordered chicken and waffles and the bo ordered a breakfast burrito . <sssss> our meals took around 25 minutes to come out and my boyfriend even commented saying how all the people sitting next to us no one had a plate in front of them . <sssss> sunday must have been a new employee training day because there was so many kids wandering around and around the restaurant with no real task at hand . <sssss> the coffee ... the coffee was good . <sssss> then , finally our food came out . <sssss> my chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded . <sssss> my waffle was half a waffle . <sssss> two pieces came out and they were toasted cajun style -lrb- like a brick -rrb- i think they were seasoned with a pepper or something too ? <sssss> my scrambled eggs came out already mixed with syrup . <sssss> boy 's burrito came out on a green pita wrap tortilla and carne mixed with eggs and some avocado on the side . <sssss> the `` carne '' or meat had a lot of fat on it . <sssss> breakfast was $ 30 . <sssss> i wont be back .
HIG		this place is great ! <sssss> good food , and good service . <sssss> we had a large group hh and our server jay was very patient and happy to suggest plates over others . <sssss> i told him my dad was back in the us from afghanistan and the owner came out to let me dad know all his drinks/meal were on the house ! <sssss> whoot whoot !! <sssss> america !! <sssss> f ** ck yea !! <sssss> anywho - this place has a super cool patio with a walk way bridge over water . <sssss> new mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor : - -rrb-
LOW		i 'm convinced everywhere i go sucks . <sssss> this place was at the chandler mall . <sssss> nice ambiance inside and family oriented . <sssss> the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever . <sssss> the marinara sauce did n't have any spices or hint of authentic italian to it . <sssss> the whole menu is literally spaghetti so do n't go with the idea of getting any other kind of italian dish . <sssss> the meatballs same thing . <sssss> no big italian taste or spiciness . <sssss> the appetizer - the artichoke dip was bland . <sssss> felt like old people food or kid friendly food . <sssss> nothing for your palette to discover . <sssss> very blah . <sssss> just save your money and go to oregano 's where your never disappointed i guess .
HIG		my mom took me here and we were the only non-asian people in the place so we were very excited . <sssss> it was not very busy but it was during the week so maybe that was the reason . <sssss> we ordered hot green tea to start with then i ordered the won ton soup and my mom ordered a dinner special that was chicken chow mien with friend rice , 2 crab puffs , and 1 egg roll -lrb- i ate the crab puffs :-d -rrb- . <sssss> my won ton soup was huge and absolutely delicious !! <sssss> i want to tell the world about this place to share it 's deliciousness . <sssss> it had wontons , chicken , shrimp , and steak pieces all inside this soup . <sssss> i could n't finish it all and packed the leftovers for the bf to enjoy . <sssss> i 'll be back -lrb- arnold voice -rrb- .
LOW		we went in around 830pm on a friday night and it was very quiet inside . <sssss> we asked about any dj or live music and the bartenders explained that they have a dj but not sure when they were coming in . <sssss> we had a couple of drinks and hung out for about 45 min . <sssss> and still no music . <sssss> this bar has so much potential with it 's awesome location within the historical hotel san carlos . <sssss> i was so disappointed to not have it be more lively or organized enough to have a dj that comes in a specific time each night on the weekends . <sssss> prices were average for the bar . <sssss> it felt like this place has n't been updated in a while and there is like a huge bubble lamp with a hot pink light inside ... ... the cool part is the chandeliers and the `` vip '' section that looks like my grandma 's living room .
LOW		we had a reservation on a sunday and they sat us right away which was nice since it was packed . <sssss> it was open kitchen and we could see the brick oven cooking all the pizzas . <sssss> i ordered a wine cooler since they are pretty popular as it was very strong and refreshing . <sssss> we ordered a chop salad to split and it was one of the best chop salads we had ! <sssss> wish it was larger since our split portion of the meatball was on the smaller side . <sssss> pizza was good . <sssss> service could have been way better also .
MID		omg so good and huge servings ! <sssss> the chefs specialty shrimp dish us my favorite .
MID		this place is the real deal . <sssss> no server , just order at the counter and wait for your magic number to be called . <sssss> there are so many tempting things around you to eat while you are waiting which just makes you feel like you are waiting forever . <sssss> they serve beer here so that 's good to know . <sssss> if you are looking for a restaurant experience then go somewhere else . <sssss> the burritos are huge and the plates all come with rice and beans -lrb- this is important to me lol -rrb- the salsas are all very good . <sssss> i will be eating here again !
LOW		i usually only give 1 star to places so i guess that means i 'd go back right ? <sssss> yea - i 'd go back i guess . <sssss> `` best '' carne asada burrito ???? <sssss> i dunno ??? <sssss> ... . <sssss> . <sssss> we thought about it and the meat was good . <sssss> but its too pricey . <sssss> we bought 2 carne asada burritos -lrb- not very big btw -rrb- , ceviche , 2 beers and it was $ 28 bux . <sssss> dude - that is too expensive for a taco shop . <sssss> the ceviche was no good . <sssss> like - at all . <sssss> do n't order it . <sssss> next time , yes - next time , i 'm gon na order just carne asada tacos and see if i like it better .
LOW		we went this afternoon for a late breakfast . <sssss> i 've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to north phoenix . <sssss> we walked in and the whole `` man vs food '' situation was posted everywhere . <sssss> we decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split . <sssss> i ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips ... ... ... -lrb- weird -rrb- ... ... ok - so no chips lol . <sssss> our torta arrived and it was huge !!! <sssss> so i 'm all excited about this giant mexican sandwich but then i realized that i 'm not going to be able to bite into it because it 's so huge -lrb- that 's what she said - i know -rrb- ok so i split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting . <sssss> there is every animal inside of this thing . <sssss> literally . <sssss> ham , pork chop , hot dog , shredded chicken , carne asada , and fried chicken , and chicken fried steak -lrb- i think ? <sssss> -rrb- ok so like the top half started out good but then i got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak . <sssss> then i threw off the hot dogs . <sssss> then i just decided i was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was no flavor in the sandwich . <sssss> i was disgusted and just left it . <sssss> i honestly thought i was going to vomit on the way home because i just ingested who knows how many calories and did n't even find joy in it . <sssss> oh - and our bill was $ 38.00 -lrb- the sandwich is $ 20 alone plus i got the agua de piña and travis got a sprite . <sssss> we tried it at least ? <sssss> bleh .
MID		every employee that we interacted with was extremely friendly and outgoing and get this ... smiling ! <sssss> who does that anymore ??? <sssss> anyways - they all were really fun and made our dining experience so much more comfortable than other snobby places in scottsdale . <sssss> for example : bungalow bar and grill . <sssss> i literally walked into the place and greeted the employees ... is n't that their job ?? <sssss> ok - i 'm getting off topic . <sssss> pearl sushi is good sushi for a tolerable price and has great employees that look happy to be there . <sssss> shout out to our server/bartender christina lee . <sssss> that girl was so funny !!
LOW		ordered it this weekend . <sssss> they cut the pizza into squares instead of slices and i really like crust : -lrb- the sauce was good though . <sssss> it tasted really good the next morning unmicrowaved so i appreciated that . <sssss> i usually order barros so im forgiving of this place for not being better since barros is pretty bomb . <sssss> i 'd eat spinato 's again but only if there was n't a barros or venezia 's close by .
MID		food was excellent . <sssss> kind of in a crappy part of town . <sssss> they pour healthy glasses of wine = -- rrb - and the food is served in a presentation format . <sssss> the decor made me feel like scarface might be sitting a few tables away . <sssss> the decor in the bar is dated and the mirrors all over the place made me feel funny . <sssss> the service was fantastic and you feel very comfortable making conversation without worrying about being `` too loud '' .
LOW		my dad ordered a chile relleno ... and it came out with what looked like chicken inside ?? <sssss> what the ??? <sssss> i flagged down our sweet server norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way , aunt chilada 's does . <sssss> it seriously looked like canned chicken and i was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside . <sssss> my dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky . <sssss> salsa was average ... nothing about this place was `` mexican '' and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out . <sssss> never again will i spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company . <sssss> aunt chilada 's ... you fail !
LOW		we tried it this weekend and i have been wanting to try this place for a while so we went . <sssss> it was a littler dark inside , quiet , and our server was just okay maybe she just wanted to go enjoy her weekend but - if she has the same personality she did with us , i 'm sure her plans were not amazing . <sssss> anways - we started with the calamari and it was delicious . <sssss> this red sauce they have is really spicy and sweet at the same time and we asked for another serving of it . <sssss> the server told me she could write down the recipe but i told her no need - i am far too lazy to actually `` try '' and recreate it . <sssss> but the thought was nice . <sssss> for our entrees , i ordered this macadamia crusted mahi-mahi and travis got the sampler of 3 different fish dishes . <sssss> my dish came sitting on top of some mashed potatoes with 3 sticks of asparagus and 6 chopped slices of red potato . <sssss> travis got a bowl of rice with his . <sssss> it looked like my dish was better . <sssss> i thought my dish was filling also . <sssss> travis , on the other hand ordered a burger 3 hours later . <sssss> our bill was $ 99 bucks total with each of us getting one alcoholic beverage . <sssss> if we do return it will be for the calamari only .
HIG		this place is super yummy ! <sssss> i do miss my favorite gelato scooper hannah grout however ! <sssss> its the friendly employees that make my visits enjoyable !
LOW		i have heard about all the past famous diners here such as president bush , and many athelets , etc. . <sssss> we walked in around 6pm and my bf was like , `` this is the place ? <sssss> are you sure ? <sssss> is it even open ??? '' <sssss> it was dead inside . <sssss> ill just skip to the food part - i ordered this dish that came with a ground beef taco , cheese enchilada , and beef tamale . <sssss> all of it was good expect the tamale which tasted `` grainy '' ok here we go , long story short i wont be going again but glad i went to say i 've been .
MID		its not four peaks - but , it 's good ! <sssss> so just go . <sssss> and - order the santan beer sampler . <sssss> its fun , comes out with all the beers so you can decide which you like best . <sssss> my favs are the devil ale and sunspot .
LOW		my boyfriend 's fav . <sssss> place and the stein of beers are priced pretty good . <sssss> game nights get super packed so go early to save a seat . <sssss> kitchen closes at midnight which is too early when your buzz kicks in around 1am .
LOW		definite dive but the food was good . <sssss> they dont have carne asada ??! <sssss> that is weird to me ... only green chile or red chile on the menu . <sssss> i was thinking - maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive - but then ; there was tons of people in there so how can they not afford the meat when filibertos has it ?? <sssss> lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 burrito and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas ... im sorry - but that 's way too long for simple taco truck orders . <sssss> the salsa cups are like the size of a thimble so i had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table . <sssss> the restaurant is in a sketchy part of town and if it was n't daytime with my stud of a bf , i would be concerned for my life and purse . <sssss> okay - back to the food . <sssss> the burrito was good . <sssss> the gauc is good . <sssss> it was all good but the menu is n't something to rave about . <sssss> im mexican so i could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called .
LOW		meh . <sssss> the place is good . <sssss> their salsa is no good though and that is the main reason i never crave this place . <sssss> their california burrito and breakfast burritos are good though . <sssss> i hardly crave or request this place but it 's edible and i would n't turn it down if someone wanted to go there . <sssss> there 's better is all . <sssss> casual inside and you order at the counter .
MID		had a great time enjoying northern italian with some greek options also . <sssss> this place has it all ! <sssss> duck , veal , shrimp , salmon , lamb , halibut , chicken , pasta , calamari , and meatballs ! <sssss> it was all very delicious and the service was great . <sssss> the servers had great personalities and the ambiance is upscale and dim . <sssss> nice patio also . <sssss> accessible via the lightrail for those of you that take advantage of public transportation .
HIG		el chorro sits right on the backside of camelback mountain and has a southwestern decor and gorgeous patio . <sssss> casual dress or a nice dress could be worn here . <sssss> the menu has a variety of options . <sssss> we started off with a shrimp pot dish and it was deelish . <sssss> my entree was trout almondine with green beans -lrb- ordered a separate side of scalloped potatoes also -rrb- my dish was prepared perfectly and did n't walk out feeling overly stuffed -lrb- like my usual -rrb- so i felt pretty good about myself for having the self discipline to not order a dessert . <sssss> sit on the patio if you can !!!!
MID		this place is busy , had live music in the bar , and the servers were trying to squeeze by . <sssss> the seafood is flown in daily and i think our bill helped fund a grouper or two 's first class seat . <sssss> i ordered the grouper with crab on top -lrb- as an extra - you can ask for it this way -rrb- . <sssss> ordered the lobster mashed again , and green beans -lrb- if it ai n't broke - do n't order something else . <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> had a great night !
HIG		our server was great , attentive and personable !! <sssss> you dont find that much these days so that is why im complimenting this location . <sssss> we ordered a beef something salad -lrb- amazing ! <sssss> -rrb- , chicago pan pizza -lrb- takes 45 min . <sssss> btw -rrb- , and my first ever pizza-cookie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> how on earth did it take me so long to get one ? <sssss> i dont know ... i have discovered a new vice and that is the pizza cookie !! <sssss> my only drag about this place is how they dont take reservations ... which is lame to me since the waits are always so long * we got sat right away last night though !! <sssss> im just saying - they should take reservations . <sssss> oregano 's and the service was awesome .
HIG		if i could eat pita jungle every day i would !!! <sssss> my favorite things to order are jalapeño cilantro hummus with chicken , the greek salad , the mahi mahi dish , and the chicken shwarma . <sssss> great happy hour here and the menu is n't expensive . <sssss> love love love some pita jungle !!!!!!!!!
MID		cool spot , interesting tables and pews . <sssss> never even knew what a pasty was before i went here . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> good beer . <sssss> i liked it . <sssss> its a good place to take someone from out of town for lunch .
MID		went with the bestie to this spot and at first had trouble finding the entrance but entered a totally trendy , hip , casual restaurant . <sssss> love the look of the dining room . <sssss> love how the `` warehouse '' ceilings are very high . <sssss> this place just looks so cool inside . <sssss> the bar is to the left and had people staged there and there are couches to just hang out with your drink . <sssss> the kitchen is open so you can see the cooks back there . <sssss> if your looking for an aesthetically eye-pleasing spot - go here . <sssss> service was great , our server was knowledgeable on the menu and ingredients , waters kept being refilled , and our table was checked on throughout the meal . <sssss> we started with the shrimp and grits app . <sssss> -lrb- very good 5 decent shrimps -rrb- , i ordered the mahi , and mal ordered the chicken . <sssss> we both ordered a cocktail as well and those were very strong ! <sssss> my fish was a pretty large piece and had some horseradish sauce on top -lrb- meh - coulda done without it or at least on the side . <sssss> -rrb- the fish was cooked very well and i enjoyed it . <sssss> mallory 's chicken was a huge piece of like a breast , thigh , and mini-wing attached . <sssss> it looked so juicy ! <sssss> she said it was very good and i got to try a piece and it was great . <sssss> the sides are a la carte so we chose mashed potatoes , and the cauliflower . <sssss> the cauliflower was really good and seasoned with lemon and other spices . <sssss> the mashed potatoes was blended so much it was almost soup . <sssss> i 've had better potatoes . <sssss> bill was 107.00 for the two of us . <sssss> the meal was good and the place was very trendy . <sssss> if you have a birthday or other special celebration coming up totally go here .
HIG		we walked in , it was a ghost town at 5pm , walked up - ordered our dishes and special priced beers -lrb- stella and shock top ale super cheap -rrb- and like 30 seconds later it was called out ready to go !! <sssss> my bf says he sees this place smoking all their stuff early in the morning and the result : delicious ribs !!! <sssss> literally fall off the bone hell - i could have eaten the bone it was all slow cooked to perfection . <sssss> baked beans , potato salad all delicious . <sssss> i made a point to compliment the owner and he treated me to their homemade ice cream -lrb- vanilla bean -rrb- to take home = -- rrb - we will be back and this time , i 'm bringing more people . <sssss> i tell as many people i can about this unknown treasure we have finally discovered .
LOW		rude staff that would n't spit on you if you were on fire ... mixed up our party 's orders , ignored us when we needed waters . <sssss> honestly , it was the attitude of the staff that completely turned me off to this historic restaurant .
LOW		took the bf for lunch and he insisted on doing the review ... ok so first time at this beautiful looking place very traditional look . <sssss> first thing first ... no hot sauces ... no beans ... no tortillas ... i was served an italian loaf in stead of tortilla chips ... fries which is american with my tacos ... and i could of made more traditional guacamole at home ... sorry barrios cafe . <sssss> you are not a `` best in phoenix mexican restaurant ''
MID		love the set up , decor , and look of the vig uptown . <sssss> very modern and trendy . <sssss> i felt like i got a little cooler -lrb- as if possible right ?? <sssss> -rrb- from just being there . <sssss> accommodated our large party of 15 or so people and were very friendly . <sssss> the menu is sort of random and i was n't digging anything on it so i just ordered the artichoke dip . <sssss> a lot of the girls ordered the macaroni dish which was huge -lrb- why ? <sssss> -rrb- but very delicious . <sssss> had a great time and would definitely visit again . <sssss> the staff was great , i must mention again .
MID		went this morning . <sssss> ordered a ham torta sandwich and coffee . <sssss> you have to order sides as an extra but the sandwich alone filled me up and i was only able to eat half !! <sssss> the coffee was great and i mentioned it to our server . <sssss> `` it 's cartel coffee '' well that 's why !!!!!!!!!!!! <sssss> omg i love cartel and so stoked this place is right by our place ! <sssss> the scene is hipster and service is slow like the servers `` just work there , but do n't really need the money sort of way '' . <sssss> still - ill go back - and be patient , because the food is good and the coffee is bomb and its close to my house .
MID		awesome service , great menu , quiet dining room with low music playing in background , and patio seating available but no great view . <sssss> we got the appetizer trio and it was delicious ~ the trio includes large shrimp sitting in grits , second was cut up steak with paired rice with a sort `` asian '' flavor to it , and third was dungess crab and artichoke dip with bread !!! <sssss> just remembering the flavors makes my taste buds leak ! <sssss> i ordered my filet mignon medium-well and that was my mistake ... i regretted it after seeing travis cut into his prime rib and all the juices flow out . <sssss> my filet was an 8 oz cut and i had to give travis some to help me finish ! <sssss> -lrb- i think that appetizer trio filled me up -rrb- our server was knowlegable of the menu and explained that it would seasonally be changing . <sssss> it was a great dining experience so glad we did it !
MID		we went last night and boy was this placed packed ! <sssss> i 'm sure it was because of the past valentine 's day holiday many were celebrating the weekend of . <sssss> we got sat and the dining room is organized so tight i was squeezing by people to get through . <sssss> it was almost like a cafeteria it felt that tight . <sssss> there were linens on the table but still had the `` feed the masses '' effect . <sssss> the salad bar was very yummy and in the beginning our meats took a while to come even though we had our `` green '' card flipped ready to eat . <sssss> i was getting bigger cuts of meat than travis so we would trade when the servers left . <sssss> the meats were all very tasty and cooked fantastic !! <sssss> -lrb- we had been to the brazilian bull in the past which grossed me out so bad it was horrible -rrb- this experience left us very full and we had a food coma after wards . <sssss> did n't get dessert ... too full .
MID		stopped here for lunch during happy hour . <sssss> place was quiet but a dog was on the patio which i liked , so if you have a dog - bring them along . <sssss> we ordered the sausage pizza , chili , chicken drumlets -lrb- aka wings -rrb- , and a salad -lrb- for me -rrb- . <sssss> the salad was amazing !!! <sssss> it was so fresh and had yummy cuts of fresh mozzarella and green beans , etc. it was just so damn good . <sssss> the pizza was great and the chili made me think of thanksgiving it was just so hearty . <sssss> wings were wings nothing amazing . <sssss> it was just a beautiful az afternoon on the patio with a great lunch .
LOW		this place is always packed during weekends which tells me this is a great dinner spot . <sssss> but really it 's not !?!? <sssss> the food is just `` ok '' i do n't understand why this place is always so busy ??? <sssss> the service was good , salad - good , their filet mignon was ok , and their bread is whack . <sssss> they also bring this stuff to dip your bread into . <sssss> they called it something sorta fancy-like but really - it 's just cottage cheese mixed with i forget what . <sssss> lol seriously - travis and i were laughing out loud at how we were dipping our soft day old tasting bread into cottage cheese . <sssss> we drive by it and out loud pretend like we are yelling at all the people eating there , and yell out , `` it 's not that good ! '' <sssss> because it really is n't !! <sssss> why is it always so busy ?!?!
MID		went for lunch , patio was full so we waited at the bar for 10 minutes . <sssss> once sat , i contemplated over the menu as there were many items i wanted to try . <sssss> i 've been before , but it was so long ago when the place first opened so i feel like it was trying the place for the first time . <sssss> i ordered the braised pork tacos and they were very filling . <sssss> i was going to take a to-go box but there were like 10 birds in the trees above i was paranoid one slipped some shit into my plate while i looked away . <sssss> all that being said , lovely patio , busy with local diners , and the food is good with healthy options .
HIG		no freezer in the joint so when they run out of oj they have to literally go and buy more oranges ! <sssss> the food is fresh and homeade . <sssss> i have n't been to their newest location which i hear is much larger inside to accomodate the massive breakfast crowds .
LOW		hummm ? <sssss> i 'm torn on this place . <sssss> it is cute decor with okay service . <sssss> i took 5 people here for lunch and they loved it . <sssss> i felt it was okay , but my crepe was over cooked . <sssss> i do n't know if the crepe was cooked fresh , but i doubt it . <sssss> i will try it again , but i 'm not optimistic about the outcome .
LOW		so i continue to find that my wife and i continue to give this place more chances and they continue to dissappoint us . <sssss> when we placed our order we were very clear with the waitress that they continually over cook our burgers and we detailed how we like them prepared . <sssss> guess what ... ... they were both overcooked . <sssss> guess what ... ... they charged us full proce and did n't even offer an appology .
LOW		twice in 1 week you have really let me down . <sssss> for years i have had nothing but great food and great service . <sssss> then ... . <sssss> . <sssss> i called earlier this week to order a chopped salad that my pregnant wife was craving . <sssss> you were n't serving despite the fact that you were opened . <sssss> then last night was a joke . <sssss> i ordered take out , chopped salad and a short rib dinner . <sssss> when i got it home it was a chopped salad and shirt rib risotto . <sssss> when i called back in they had no apology just a `` oh we 'll be happy to make you a shirt rib dinner . '' <sssss> of course that means i have to drive back downtown ... . <sssss> . <sssss> oh , and did i mention the traffic because of a wine festival ? <sssss> when i got there , no apologies , no discount , no complimentary dessert ... ...
MID		i had great service and the red curry chicken was wonderful . <sssss> i only wish the dish wad a little warmer serving temperature . <sssss> the thia iced tea was fantastic .
HIG		my faith in humanity and cowboy ciao are restored in one fell swoop . <sssss> marianne belardi got back to me regarding my service issues and has made everything good in the world again . <sssss> i had recently moved within walking distance of the ciao and was sad to think that the cowboy had lost it 's swagger . <sssss> thankfully , i can still confidently frequent the ciao because the service is still there . <sssss> one bad experience versus hundreds of great ones only means they are human .
HIG		i love pita jungle ! <sssss> i frequent the one on indian school and 40th street , but make it around to the one in peoria and the one on shea . <sssss> regardless which one i go to the service is great , the food is fantastic and the crowd and atmosphere has wonderfully warm energy . <sssss> the only thing that i have not enjoyed greatly was the broiled chicken pita . <sssss> it was a little bland . <sssss> i have tried so many other dishes and they are all wonderful . <sssss> love you guys !!!
MID		i grew up on empanadas in panama and i have been hard pressed to find anything close to them in the u.s. . <sssss> today i found them ! <sssss> a perfectly crunchy crust and the beef was beautifully spiced . <sssss> usually empanadas are bland and soggy . <sssss> they did a great job on these . <sssss> i usually do n't like rice , but the rice and black beans were wonderful . <sssss> service was great ! <sssss> i 'll be back !
LOW		am i trying to relive the past ? <sssss> is that why i keep coming here ? <sssss> well , the cask conditioned beer is one of the big reasons . <sssss> despite all else that i am about to say ... the beer rocks !!!! <sssss> i have been enjoying four peaks for at least 8 years . <sssss> it was about 2 years ago that i started noticing changes ; changes in staff , changes in food quality and changes in managements attentiveness to the customers . <sssss> these changes obviously have not been for the better . <sssss> after visiting here this past weekend my wife and i actually started talking about this very question , `` why do we still come here ? '' <sssss> it was a short list of potential answers ; 1 . <sssss> cask conditioned beer 2 . <sssss> it 's comfortable , despite mediocre service . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> periodically we get lucky enough to have one particular server that is great . <sssss> her name is either ferris or harris ? <sssss> if she is serving we are happy . <sssss> that is a pretty short list for someone that has been coming here for years . <sssss> we used to frequent here because ; 1 . <sssss> the food was good 2 . <sssss> service was great . <sssss> 3 . <sssss> waitresses were hot 4 . <sssss> managers gave a s'@& 5 . <sssss> staff were friendly . <sssss> 6 . <sssss> great atmosphere final decision , it 's time to find a new place .
HIG		everything was a wonderful experience from the valet that received my car to the ice cream lady at churn . <sssss> service was friendly , prompt and professional . <sssss> the atmosphere was warm and inviting and it just has a great vibe . <sssss> now to top it all off the reuben was the best that i have ever had . <sssss> kind of funny when you think about it . <sssss> how good or classy can a reuben be ? <sssss> this rueben takes you beyond the typical greasy low quality experience . <sssss> the pastrami is some of the best that i have ever tasted , the sandwich was elequently done . <sssss> i would highly recommend this place for a lunch with really good friends . <sssss> it just adds to the experience of being with the ones that you love .
LOW		wow , i just do n't know what to say . <sssss> i think i will keep this review very short because there are so many things to say . <sssss> great food ... ... . <sssss> . <sssss> but it was the worst service that i have ever had !
HIG		the best donuts i 've ever had .
LOW		i am writing this review as i work my way through this dinning experience . <sssss> i have enjoyed cafe boa in the past , but it has been years . <sssss> so far we are off to a good start . <sssss> the restaurant is decorated in soothing colors , clean and relaxing . <sssss> the server is very nice and knowledgeable about the menu . <sssss> wild salmon with basmati rice and sautéed veggies sounds great . <sssss> thanks ! <sssss> uh oooh ! <sssss> the tea is weak on tea on heavy on hibiscus or jasmine or dandelion , whatever they flavor it with . <sssss> oh , and did i mention it 's empty ... . <sssss> and they are n't terribly busy and i 'm sitting at the bar . <sssss> tick-tock , tick-tock ... for as long as this is taking i 'm concerned that my salmon will be over cooked . <sssss> it 's not that busy people . <sssss> tick-tock , tick-tock ... the wait staff must sense it , because they are leaning half way through the kitchen window looking for food . <sssss> i guess this is why they have a decent beer and wine selection , got ta keep you happy during the wait . <sssss> too bad i 'm only drinking iced tea . <sssss> tick-tock , tick-tock ... as i sit and watch larger tables that came in after me being served their food . <sssss> it 's salmon not rocket science . <sssss> the salmon is a beautiful piece of fish and nearly perfectly cooked . <sssss> the fish is great but i 'm confused on where the chef was going with this dish . <sssss> it has a `` corn relish '' on top that is really just corn . <sssss> it all sits on top of a bed of rice and veggies . <sssss> the veggies are nicely cooked but they have a asian flavor that does n't match the rest of the dish . <sssss> well , i was going to rate it a 3 star until i got my bill and saw they charged me $ 19.95 for that dish . <sssss> definitely not worth it . <sssss> hi all , the owners response to my original review is below . <sssss> i did reply back to him directly , but i do n't think it will be shown to all so i am adding my response here.enjoy the reading . <sssss> dear scott , really scott ? <sssss> `` tea was full at all times , never empty as you stated '' you want to call me a liar ? <sssss> not a good plan for salvaging relationships with potential customers . <sssss> trust me when i say it was empty ... i know . <sssss> `` we understand that you were by yourself '' this means there is only one dish to focus on , it 's easy . <sssss> `` the ticket time on the grilled salmon was not unreasonable '' if this is the case then why was the waiter appologizing for it and why were other tables of 3 people receiving their food before me ? <sssss> if the ticket time was appropriate in your judgement then it is likely that either the server failed to submit the order in a timely manner or you have a it/ticketing system issue . <sssss> `` your dish , as you stated , was perfectly cooked '' yes the salmon was perfectly cooked and it was a georgeous pice of fish , but beyond the salmon there was little flavor and what flavors there were , they did not blend together to make a satisfying dish . <sssss> it was for this reason that the price was unreasonable . <sssss> it was not a good dish . <sssss> `` perfect service and not even a 15 % gratuity , really ? '' <sssss> ohhh , i 'm sorry you must have missed the part about the empty iced tea , long wait , other more complex orders for a larger group of people coming out before mine , a main dish that the flavors did n't blend well and ice tea that i did n't like . <sssss> i am a tipper that over gives and you have to work hard to get less than 20 % . <sssss> that tip was an earned tip plus a generous donation considering the experience . <sssss> your response has helped solidify my 2 star rating of cafe boa . <sssss> gary s. hi all , one last update from me . <sssss> i thought you might be interested in seeing the private note that the owner of cafe boa sent to me as a response to my last posting . <sssss> cheers , gary s. from : scott r. owner to : gary s. `` i apologize for my following tone , but your response warrants the following : my response isnt to make you change your rating , it really doesnt matter to me , most normal people know when some reviews are legit and reasonable and some are just ridiculous and silly . <sssss> we have thrived for 16 + years , no thanks to people like you . <sssss> the fact of the matter is that your experience was flawless , we serviced you with perfection , . <sssss> . <sssss> you were just looking to trash our establishment . <sssss> most of your comments above arent worth responding to , they are so silly . <sssss> we served you in a timely manner , albeit not as fast as you wanted , a high quality meal with friendly service and in return you sit there at our bar during your entire meal , typing on yelp any flaw you could find , wow , kinda sad , really . <sssss> if you are a food critic , ok then i would understand , otherwise , get a life . <sssss> we will be here for another 16 + years , you can count on that . '' <sssss> hi all , dear scott r. , using my full name in your public reponse is yet more proof of your poor ethical standards . <sssss> so all reading please be aware that if scott r. does n't take well to your critical feedback that he will take your name from your credit card receipt and try to smear you online . <sssss> good luck scott ! <sssss> gary s. gary s.
MID		the seasonal veggie sandwich was incredible . <sssss> roasted carrots , green , caramelized red onion , pumpkins seeds and feta cheese on an exquisite bread . <sssss> it was served with sweet potato chips that were a little too greasy and salty , but i guess that is what made me eat every last one . <sssss> mmmmmmmm their dessert menu was very tempting , but my resolve was strong . <sssss> i would love to come back in the evening for a nice evening with my wife .
HIG		can bread and butter really be opulent ? <sssss> i just found the answer to my question . <sssss> yes . <sssss> the bread is smooth , soft , warm and perfectly cooked -lrb- crunchy and soft -rrb- . <sssss> the `` white bread '' is actually an asiago roll roll with a crunchy top . <sssss> we then moved on to the gazpacho which was a perfect blend of coolness and hidden heat . <sssss> it was a wonderful teaser for all the other flavors to come . <sssss> the specials looked incredible , but we have some fellow foodies that raved about the mussels and the short ribs . <sssss> the mussels had a sweetness that i have never experienced with mussels . <sssss> it was star anise and while it was a bit perplexing it kept me coming back for more . <sssss> my wife and i were supposed to share , but she really did n't want to share her mussels . <sssss> the short ribs were wonderfully flavorful and perfectly cooked . <sssss> normally in a restaurant you often experience a great main dish with some weak accompaniments . <sssss> this was not the case . <sssss> the mashed potatoes , sauce and beans were exquisite . <sssss> the ambiance , service and vibe were topped of the experience . <sssss> we did n't bring our daughter with us , but we were very impressed with the kids menu . <sssss> we will bring her next time . <sssss> this will be our new regular hang out .
LOW		should this actually be a 2 star review rather than 3 ? <sssss> probably , but i have eaten here several times in the past and enjoyed the casual environment . <sssss> this seems to be the case of a good restaurant on the down hill slide . <sssss> the service has gotten worse with each visit . <sssss> this time the service was less than desirable . <sssss> there was a really cute young lady at another table that got great service from our waiter . <sssss> hey , i ca n't blame our waiter , i just do n't want my family to not have what they want or need . <sssss> when we asked him why there were only 2 tacos when he said the meal comes with 3 , he went on a diatribe about how the chef 's and servers need to get on the same page . <sssss> `` some chef 's are cool with it -lrb- 3 tacos vs. 2 -rrb- and others are n't . <sssss> we -lrb- wait staff and kitchen staff -rrb- need to get on the same page . '' <sssss> this looks like a lack of management control . <sssss> too bad ! <sssss> i likely wo n't be back any time soon .
MID		interesting ... . <sssss> so many of the reviews below talk about attitude . <sssss> a couple of thoughts on that . <sssss> first , i have been there several times and they have been nothing but friendly , genuine and sincere . <sssss> do they sound a bit rough due to esl and cultural tone ? <sssss> sure . <sssss> if you do n't like that type of tone go to the olive garden where you wo n't run into a single true italian . <sssss> second thought is , what did you do to piss them off ? <sssss> i think the tone and attitude in this market is exactly what i expect from a true italian market . <sssss> i have been to italy 6 times and this is genuine italian . <sssss> you fellow patrons will likely be speaking italian . <sssss> the food is incredible . <sssss> i am not a big fan of eggplant . <sssss> my wife asked me to try her eggplant sandwich and it was the best eggplant i have ever had . <sssss> i will probably order that next time i am in . <sssss> i had the porchetta -lrb- pork sandwich -rrb- and the pork was perfectly cooked and the bread is fresh . <sssss> the maningota is what we really go here for . <sssss> make sure you save room for dessert ! <sssss> the groceries that they offer are very limited , but they are everything you would need for an authentic italian meal . <sssss> they are also ingredients that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else .
LOW		if your looking for something chewier than beef jerky then try the short ribs . <sssss> jerky has more flavor but i think i lost weight trying to put this meal down . <sssss> the bbq chicken -lrb- chicken like product ? <sssss> -rrb- was so processed it was flavorless and texture free . <sssss> the other meat product that came on the # 8 special was the toughest of all . <sssss> now take all of these items and drown them in a sugar based sauce and you 've got a real desperate mans treat . <sssss> avoid this place !
LOW		from reading all the other reviews that rave about the food , i feel i might have set myself up for failure . <sssss> the prime rib wrap was pretty good , but i was the unlucky got that got a lot of the fatty tough meat . <sssss> the flavoring and cooking temp where spot on , i think i just got the bad spot in the roast . <sssss> i 'm the guy that always orders straight horseradish because i like the heat . <sssss> well , i was pleasantly surprised that their creamed horseradish had the perfect blend of heat and smooth creaminess . <sssss> the french fries you can tell are freshly handcut in house . <sssss> unfortunately , they were soggy from the frying oil . <sssss> i might have just had a bad luck experience . <sssss> i will tell you though , the service was fantastic . <sssss> because of the service and some the positive attributes of the food , i will give this place another try . <sssss> i suspect that i wo n't be disappointed .
LOW		wow ! <sssss> i have been coming here for years for the green flannel hash and we have never been disappointed ... ... until today . <sssss> both my wife and i noticed it was drastically different today . <sssss> i asked the waitress `` are they were using a different recipe ? '' <sssss> waitress : `` no . <sssss> why ? '' <sssss> me : `` it does n't taste anything like it usually does . '' <sssss> waitress : `` oh , does the cornbeef not have any flavor ? '' <sssss> me : `` yeah . '' <sssss> waitress : `` oh we 've been hearing that a lot from our customers . '' <sssss> she walks away and returns with a full bill despite the fact that we did n't like or eat our dishes .
MID		we have been here so many times and every time it is great food and great service . <sssss> this time we did get one meal that was very bland . <sssss> i brought it to the servers attention . <sssss> on the way back from the restroom the manager stopped me to shake my hand and thank me for brining it to their attention . <sssss> `` i would rather find out these issues early in the morning -lrb- it was early morning -rrb- than go through the entire day serving bland food . '' <sssss> we then later overhead him talking to the kitchen staff and asking if that dish had been adjusted . <sssss> they also took care of a portion of the bill . <sssss> timely , kind and sincere response to a negative customer experience will always keep me coming back . <sssss> every restaurant will have it 's issues from time to time , but it is all in how they respond to them . <sssss> this managers actions and demeanor where the true example of customer service .
LOW		uhmmm ... . <sssss> i really want to love the place . <sssss> the spicy is right , the flavors are good , but they overcooked the meat in the dish . <sssss> that explains why it took so long to get the food out . <sssss> i will give it another try .
LOW		it is really sad to have to write a 1 star review for this place . <sssss> the food 4 stars , the fact that it is family own and run is a 5 stars , but service that i have received from the manager , david is a -3 stars . <sssss> on the first day that the yelp coupon was released i bought it and used it . <sssss> when i checked out , the cashier was confused because i was the first one to use the coupon . <sssss> i later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price , $ 34.18 . <sssss> she then charged my card for $ 26.04 . <sssss> i know my math skills are a little rusty , but that is not a $ 14.00 discount , plus i was charged twice . <sssss> that is not where the major problem lies . <sssss> the major problem was that i had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager . <sssss> when i finally did get a hold of david he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who i was or what i wanted . <sssss> he also stated that i `` should have left him a message about what my concern was . '' <sssss> first david , you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message . <sssss> secondly , i was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their english to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number . <sssss> i have no problem with the fact that they struggled with english , but do n't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because i did n't leave a message under these circumstances . <sssss> here we are more than 2 weeks later and i still am struggling to get my money back . <sssss> if the owner reads this , then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this . <sssss> we were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago . <sssss> we were on our way to being devout customers , but this might have changed that , primarily due to david 's attitude with me .
MID		the owner did contact and resolved my concerns . <sssss> the food is fantastic and well worth your trip !!!
MID		one of my new favorite restaurants in my area . <sssss> being vegetarian , i love the chinese vegetable quesadilla with their delicious hot sauce drizzled all over it . <sssss> i normally get this with a refried bean burrito -lrb- combo -rrb- , white rice and refried beans on the side . <sssss> this is a ton of food . <sssss> my girlfriend & i normally split this meal and are plenty full afterwards . <sssss> the finishing touch of a snickerdoodle cookie is fantastic . <sssss> love this place .
MID		my bro and i dropped into this bro spot -lrb- santisi bros -rrb- today for lunch . <sssss> i 've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood . <sssss> it 's dark inside , so prepared to be blinded if you exit mid-day . <sssss> tons of tv 's lining the walls , most tuned in to a sporting event . <sssss> good beer & drink selection and good food selection . <sssss> pizzas , pastas , salads , calzones , sandwiches and more . <sssss> today i went with the eggplant parmesan sub and i really think it is the best damn one i have ever had . <sssss> so damn tasty and perfect . <sssss> crisp bread with a soft inside , crispy eggplant slices , delish cheese . <sssss> i do n't think it can get any better . <sssss> there pasta dishes are also huge , so be prepared . <sssss> santisi is a great neighborhood sports bar who happens to also make some damn good food . <sssss> recommended .
HIG		i still love chino bandido , even as a vegan . <sssss> my normal purchases are : a combo meal with veggie `` quesadilla '' -lrb- no cheese -rrb- + black bean burrito -lrb- no cheese -rrb- , refried beans -lrb- no cheese -rrb- and white rice . <sssss> the veggie no cheese quesadilla still has a crisped up tortilla piled in with lettuce , broccoli & tomato bits . <sssss> i drench it in their fantastic hot sauce & dab in some refried beans . <sssss> the no cheese burrito still has the best texture as you bite through the just right chewy tortilla into the soft beans , drenched with hot sauce of course . <sssss> on the weekends , i like to get a tostada no cheese too . <sssss> the staff is always friendly and willing to highlight and accentuate the no-cheese requests on my order form .
MID		loved it ! <sssss> unique ecuadorian/peruvian/south american food with good flavors , excellent presentation and a good variety . <sssss> the vegetarian plate comes with veggie flan doused with cheese sauce , grilled plantains , a mound of rice , lentils in a tasty sauce and a fried egg over easy , cooked oh so right . <sssss> for those of you who are n't in the know , mash down the rice mound , salt it up , then throw the fried egg on top . <sssss> chop it up and feast ! <sssss> i love me some fried eggs & rice and they make the ingredients perfect here . <sssss> if you 're looking for some unique flavors & food combinations that are sure to impress , check this place out !
MID		as many previous yelp reviews state , captain bill 's is a great place to grab a sub on the cheap . <sssss> vegetarians can opt for `` the veggie '' , which should probably be renamed `` the cheesie '' . <sssss> it comes packed with 3 types of cheese , a variety of veggies -lrb- including avocado -rrb- and is best topped with their delish italian dressing . <sssss> the inside of this eatery is plastered with stickers , photos , and other decor . <sssss> most of the stickers and signs are comedic in nature , so look around a read while you 're there , you 're sure to get a chuckle at some of their stuff . <sssss> good subs cheap . <sssss> fun atmosphere . <sssss> i dig it .
MID		my lovely woman and i stayed at the clarendon this past weekend , so we had plenty of encounters with gallo blanco and we dug it . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with their fresh , made when you order it , guacamole and house-made tortilla chips . <sssss> that is some damn good guac ! <sssss> in addition to the normal ingredients that you would expect -lrb- avocado , tomato , onion , spices -rrb- they also include some tangerine or a similar fruit in there , giving it a tasty variation . <sssss> we ordered it as an app before dinner and also during the day while we were chillin poolside . <sssss> good stuff ! <sssss> the grilled corn appetizer -lrb- elote callajero -rrb- with cotija cheese and smoked paprika is also a unique and tasty treat . <sssss> they 'll even cut it in half for ya if you want to share with someone else . <sssss> for din-din , my girl enjoyed their fish tacos more than the carne asada taco . <sssss> i was satisfied with the veggie tacos . <sssss> a good mix of grilled veggies and other taco goodies was included , along with a fresh lime . <sssss> got ta love fresh lime juice squeezed on fresh ingredient packed tacos . <sssss> if you want a little somethin extra , their house-made french-fries are delicious and will only run you $ 2 for a side . <sssss> the dining area has large glass windows that you can sit up against , which is pretty cool and allows for a good view of the surrounding area . <sssss> the bar area had a live music performance on saturday night , which was a welcome addition . <sssss> my only suggestion for gallo blanco would be to expand their drink selections and availability . <sssss> i 'd like to see a good pale ale -lrb- like sierra nevada -rrb- put on tap there . <sssss> they do have a oak creek hefeweisen and a nimbus dark amber , so i give them props for covering those beer styles , but i still want a good pale ale . <sssss> as far as mixed drinks go , my girlfriend wanted a strawberry daiquiri to sip on while we were lounging poolside and they were unable to make one for us . <sssss> after i found that out , i asked if they could make a strawberry anything for her and they agreed to make a strawberry margarita , although they seemed very reluctant to do so . <sssss> overall , the environment is awesome , the service is good and the food is good . <sssss> i would definitely recommend that you check it out .
MID		checked out next coffee today for #gangplanknw the place is spacious , with lots of tables , chairs , couches & bar areas to work from . <sssss> on thursdays & friday 's , they have an omelet bar , cooking up made to order omelets . <sssss> i tried a veggie omelet with feta & parmesan & thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> they have a couple different iced tea choices , with free refills included . <sssss> i tried a green iced tea with fruit flavors & it hit the spot . <sssss> the wifi was acceptable for the majority of the time i was there . <sssss> at one point , i could not pull any data & could not reach the dhcp server . <sssss> after rebooting my pc , i was able to reconnect with no issues . <sssss> next is a great place to grab some coffee , tea , breakfast and meet up with some people . <sssss> i 'll be visiting regularly .
MID		ice house tavern is a dive bar with character . <sssss> behind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the arcadia ice rink on the other side . <sssss> the coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink . <sssss> when we first arrived , there was a hockey game in mid-swing . <sssss> there were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide , with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us . <sssss> i found this to be highly entertaining , but it could definitely cause some people to get startled , so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked . <sssss> they 've got darts , video games , plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection . <sssss> i wish they had a good micro-brew on tap , but alas , i settled for the bottle route . <sssss> thankfully , they 've got some awesome bottled beers , like the 22 oz arrogant bastard ale from stone brewery and kiltlifter from four peaks . <sssss> cool -lrb- literally -rrb- & unique dive bar . <sssss> check it out and then test your luck out on the ice . <sssss> p.s. . <sssss> the place can be a bit difficult to find if you do n't know where it is . <sssss> drive to the left of wal-mart and into the back alley area , passing arcadia ice rink & then make a left . <sssss> you 'll see banners at the top of the end of the first building . <sssss> that 's the spot . <sssss> enter on the side .
MID		i would n't eat here for other meals , just breakfast . <sssss> they 've got some decent dishes and actually just added some new $ 5.99 breakfast plates . <sssss> on my visit this past weekend , i ordered up their egg , cheese & jalapeno enchiladas , which come smothered in a tasty tomatillo green sauce . <sssss> i also added a side of red skinned breakfast taters for 99c . <sssss> we like to order up their `` hibiscus coolers '' with our late morning breakfasts . <sssss> sparkling wine + cranberry juice . <sssss> try it out ! <sssss> if you sign up for their `` e club '' you get a free breakfast coupon on email . <sssss> it 's a risk free way for you to try them out ! <sssss> http://www.mimiscafe.com/eclub.aspx
MID		the roosevelt -lrb- http://twitpic.com/408gd -rrb- has an impressive beer selection -lrb- both on draft and in bottles -rrb- , very friendly staff and the place itself is very interesting . <sssss> beer prices are reasonable . <sssss> it is located inside of an old house that has been renovated and transformed into a bar . <sssss> the place has high ceilings , unlike similar historic homes in the area . <sssss> we had a good time there on a sunday afternoon , relaxin at the bar and chatting with the bar tenders . <sssss> we did not try the food . <sssss> we 'll be back !
LOW		hey ! <sssss> they 've got vegan bean pupusas ! <sssss> what 's a pupusa ? <sssss> a breaded pocket , kinda like a really really thick doughy tortilla , with a filling inside . <sssss> the 2 papusa combo comes with rice -lrb- made with no animal products -rrb- , a little cup of beans , salsa and a spicy coleslaw that is delish . <sssss> their menu says `` ask about our vegan & vegetarian options '' , but when i told our server we were vegan , she suggested a bunch of cheese items , so apparently she did n't know what vegan means , but i explained . <sssss> even so , it 's nice that they have options for those of the vegan persuasion . <sssss> i am bummed that they only have one papusa option for us and that is beans . <sssss> there are a few other veggie + cheese types , but they told us that the fillings are premade and they ca n't remove the cheese , so that 's lame . <sssss> we also asked if they could make us a potato papusa and they said no . <sssss> wish they would offer a few more vegan options , especially some additional vegan pupusa types !
HIG		almost every single time we go , we have a great experience at my big fat greek restaurant . <sssss> our latest trip -lrb- this past saturday -rrb- , was no exception . <sssss> food was awesome , service was good and the overall experience was great . <sssss> vegetarian recommendations : greek fries , pizza salad -lrb- so damn good -rrb- , vegetarian moussaka , lemon potatoes & lemon rice .
MID		hobo eggs dish = ridiculous . <sssss> my waiter warned me that it was `` alot of food '' . <sssss> i thought , ok , it 's gon na be a big plate of food . <sssss> i was wrong , way wrong . <sssss> it 's not a big plate of food , it is a mountain of food ! <sssss> http://twitpic.com/awqxk a tasty mountain of hashbrowns , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , peppers & eggs , with the majority of it being hashbrowns . <sssss> this behemoth of a serving had me shocked & joyed . <sssss> crazy otto 's made my day yesterday . <sssss> i 'll be eating leftovers all week .
LOW		this place has a monopoly on high profile stand up comedy in the valley , and they know it . <sssss> they use that monopoly to their advantage with abusive policies -lrb- to the customer -rrb- and bad service . <sssss> their policies are total crap . <sssss> we recently bought some tickets to a 7pm show and when we found out that we could n't attend that show , we called and tried to get our tickets swapped to the 9:45 pm show . <sssss> after emailing and calling multiple times -lrb- and leaving voicemails -rrb- , i finally got someone on the line . <sssss> they went on and on about how there are no refunds or transfers whatsoever , but then they went on to say that they could check with their supervisor to see if we could exchange our tickets for the 9:45 pm show . <sssss> the person got back to me and said , yes , we could exchange our tickets to the later show , but there would be a $ 5 transfer charge per ticket . <sssss> i asked him how they could have a transfer fee if their policy does n't even allow transfers/exchanges ? <sssss> he could n't answer that one , of course . <sssss> we opted to do the exchange and attended the show . <sssss> once you get there , you 'll note that the place is extremely packed with chairs . <sssss> they sardine as many people as possible into the venue . <sssss> many of the seats and arrangements are uncomfortable in my opinion . <sssss> once you are wedged into your seat , you are then reminded that they `` require '' that you purchase 2 drinks during your stay , at highly inflated prices , of course . <sssss> they do n't have hot tea as a beverage option any more -lrb- they used to -rrb- and i hear the iced tea is $ 10 a glass . <sssss> in addition , gratuity is automatically added to your bill , so even if your service is bad , your server gets a tip anyway ! <sssss> i love stand up comedy , but i despise this place . <sssss> i wo n't be attending their shows and dealing with their heavy handed , turnip squeezing tactics .
MID		i 'm a fan of these types of mexican restaurants . <sssss> it 's the line up and order what you want and they scoop all your ingredients onto your burrito right in front of you steez . <sssss> it 's the chipotle/qdoba/kokopelli / cafe rio style place . <sssss> what sets bajio apart from these other spots ? <sssss> i think their restaurant is a bit nicer & they have some additional options that you might not find at the other guys . <sssss> 3 types of beans : refried , black & spicy 2 types of rice : mexican style & sweet tons of types of sauces if you 're a fan of this type of mexican & you want lots of choices , give bajio a try .
HIG		hey vegans , they 've got a menu guide just for you -lrb- ask for it -rrb- , showing exactly what dishes are vegan and which are not . <sssss> they 'll also happily substitute ingredients in and out of any dish to make them vegan for you . <sssss> i recommend : the potato garlic dip , the hummus -lrb- get the regular pitas , the greek ones have dairy in them -rrb- , thousand beans , the macro platter and there are a few more good ones as well .
MID		w00t ! <sssss> a coffee spot that carries almond milk ! <sssss> now i know what you must be thinking ... `` big deal , almond milk ? '' <sssss> ... but yes , it is a big deal , a very big deal . <sssss> you see , 99 % of coffee shops choose to solely carry soy milk alone as their non-dairy creamer alternative . <sssss> unfortunately , you are currently reading the writings of a vegan who is allergic to soy milk , makes my throat all itchy and sore feeling , but i digress ... royal made me happy by offering almond milk and i happily slurped down my iced vanilla almond milk latte while traversing the many wonders of the phoenix open air public market on saturday morning . <sssss> -1 star since i had to mix up my drink myself . <sssss> take note other coffee shops : please carry another non-dairy creamer besides soy milk .
LOW		stopped in for their grand opening , in which they were giving away all of their food for free ! <sssss> my wife and i ordered the # 1 , # 2 and # 3 , which were the hummus plate , fattoush salad and a falafel plate , respectively . <sssss> we also got a side of small french fries . <sssss> hummus was a nice big size and tasty , although it only comes with one piece of pita bread and could definitely use more -lrb- we had to go up and request an additional pita bread -rrb- . <sssss> the fattoush salad was delish ! <sssss> great combo of veggies/toasted pita chips & dressing . <sssss> the falafel plate was also tasty . <sssss> it included 5 or so flattened falafel balls , each with a squirt of tahini on top . <sssss> i really liked this dish and this says a lot , as i 'm a picky customer when it comes to falafel . <sssss> many places fry their falafel too much or do something else strange where they turn out dark and overfried . <sssss> those types tend to upset my stomach , but not the falafel from good fellas ! <sssss> it was good stuff . <sssss> i do have a few suggestions for improvement . <sssss> i 'd like to see a veggie combo full meal plate , as all the veggie items mentioned above are just appetizers . <sssss> i 'd like to be able to order a side of rice , but their rice contains a chicken base , so it 's not an option for us . <sssss> no dolmas/dolmades ? <sssss> whassup with that . <sssss> the falafel plate has a ton of lettuce & tomato under it , but no dressing . <sssss> would like to see a dressing or side of dressing offered for that . <sssss> would also love to see a vegan soup offered .

HIG		i give richardson 's 5 stars for their breakfast ! <sssss> we go here all the time for breakfast/brunch on the weekends and almost always enjoy it thoroughly . <sssss> note : i do not eat dinner there , as there is not much of a vegetarian selection besides their pizza . <sssss> but back to their fabulous breakfasts ... i absolutely love their enchiladas & eggs dish . <sssss> i normally order my eggs fried over medium , which are then set atop cheese enchiladas covered in chile -lrb- get the red if you 're vegetarian -rrb- . <sssss> the red chile is made just right , with the perfect amount of spiciness & flavor . <sssss> the dish also comes served with delicious beans & potatoes . <sssss> the huevos rancheros are also damn good & are my number 2 pick . <sssss> the service is typically great . <sssss> on one visit with some friends , we ordered a few prickly pear margaritas to start the day off right . <sssss> when the drinks arrived and they did n't even look purple , we complained and our waiter happily brought us some extra prickly pear juice . <sssss> on another occasion , my girlfriend ordered a bloody mary . <sssss> bloody mary 's come with a shot of mexi-beer . <sssss> when we were casually chatting with our waiter and told him that we did n't like that type of beer , he swapped it out with a chimay shot for free ! <sssss> we love the food and they always treat us right , so we 'll keep coming back .
HIG		oregano 's on camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers . <sssss> we always take out of town guests there . <sssss> the outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out , eat and drink . <sssss> you can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside , enjoying the breeze , the sun or a sunset . <sssss> good music is always playing -lrb- jazz and other boppy tunes -rrb- and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night . <sssss> they have a decent beer and wine selection , including some good ones for beer connoisseurs . <sssss> pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable . <sssss> the food is fantastic . <sssss> for appetizers , we really like the guacatoni -lrb- quesadilla served with fresh guac -rrb- and the spicy ravioli 's . <sssss> pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones . <sssss> there 's also a good variety of pastas and salads . <sssss> for us , it does n't get much better then oregano 's . <sssss> yes , the place is usually crowded and you 'll have to wait for a table . <sssss> yes , there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside , but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks .
HIG		i would give my big fat greek restaurant 4.5 stars if possible , but since i ca n't , i 'm rounding up in this instance . <sssss> we frequent the location in downtown phoenix at the arizona center . <sssss> the outdoor patio seating is great , it has a nice view of the arizona center plaza & park , with the calming sounds of the waterfalls right near the patio . <sssss> for starters , try the greek fries . <sssss> they serve a heft plate of french fries topped with a tart lemony sauce and cheeses -lrb- including feta -rrb- . <sssss> this app is delishhhh . <sssss> the happy hour -lrb- 4-7pm -rrb- specials get my stamp of approval . <sssss> they offer $ 3 large beers on tap , including some super good beers like alaskan amber . <sssss> they 're worth a visit just for their beer specials . <sssss> for the main courses , one of our favorite dishes is the pizza salad . <sssss> you get a plate of warm , toasty pizza crust with a delicious salad thrown on top . <sssss> the salad is dressed with feta cheese and a tasty balsamic vinaigrette dressing . <sssss> it is very difficult for me to not order the pizza salad when i 'm at mbfg restaurant . <sssss> another good dish is the vegetarian mousaka -lrb- http://twitpic.com/46x9h -rrb- , however it can be a little bit sweet . <sssss> the lemon potatoes and lemon rice are very tasty , if you 're into lemon flavored sides . <sssss> give mbfg restaurant a try , even if it 's just for their happy hour beers .
LOW		il posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects . <sssss> the outside patio area is completely awesome . <sssss> it 's like you 're sitting in a little italian cafe , with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style european building . <sssss> there are christmas lights strung about in different locations , a small bar area , a lil fountain and some other cool decorations . <sssss> it 's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area , if only to have some drinks . <sssss> the service was awesome . <sssss> our waiter was totally cool , friendly and accommodating . <sssss> the fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic . <sssss> loved it . <sssss> they had local beer -lrb- kiltlifter -rrb- on tap for only $ 3 a pint . <sssss> awesome . <sssss> the salads and pasta entrees were just ok , which is the reason behind my 3 star rating . <sssss> i just was n't wowed by the main course . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back to try them again though , perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas . <sssss> i predict a review sequel in my future .
MID		this is my favorite theater near my north phoenix residence . <sssss> why ? <sssss> 1 -rrb- the theater is pretty new , which means good audio/visual equipment , comfortable seating and a bright & shiny experience . <sssss> 2 -rrb- harkin 's t-shirt program ! <sssss> you can buy a harkin 's tee for around $ 20 , which allows you to get a free popcorn all year long at any harkin 's theater . <sssss> even if i 'm not hungry , the smell of fresh popped corn at the theater will get me running to scoop some up . <sssss> i luv me some poppin corn ! <sssss> yes , i 'm an addict . <sssss> we go here when we 're not doing a early bird $ 5 special at amc deervalley 30 .
LOW		recently visited hanny 's for the first time and received crap service from a waitress with an attitude . <sssss> she was not willing to happily accommodate any requests and acted put-off at anything we asked about or asked for . <sssss> plus , the place was n't even busy while we were there , it was pretty empty . <sssss> that 's how you drive customers away .
LOW		checked out this whole foods for the first time yesterday and we were very disappointed . <sssss> much smaller than other whole foods locations we 've been to , less selection and pretty expensive -lrb- although most whole foods are expensive -rrb- . <sssss> i definitely wo n't be making any more special trips to this location .
MID		as far as the breakfast goes , sylvia 's kicks some major arse . <sssss> it is definitely one of my favorite spots to hit in phoenix for some b-fast . <sssss> lunch or dinner , i can not comment on , as i only go here for breakfast . <sssss> the place has a rockin chips & salsa bar . <sssss> we start out our mexi-break-feast by piling up some regular tortilla chips along with some tostada chips in a bowl . <sssss> for dippin , they 've got a red hot sauce , a traditional red salsa with tomato , onions , cilantro , peppers , etc and they also now have a creamy , spicy guaca-salsa , which is delicious ! <sssss> their coffee is unique and very good . <sssss> it is a cinnamon spiced blend , which complements their food very well . <sssss> they have many mexican breakfast items that you would expect , and some that you might not . <sssss> one of our favorites is the breakfast quesadilla , which is pretty large & perfect for splitting with someone else . <sssss> this tasty dish includes eggs , cheese , green chiles & some other stuff . <sssss> their hashbrowns are delish and come with green chiles and cheese on top . <sssss> order a side of those to complement your meal . <sssss> the only reason i did n't give sylvia 's 5/5 is due to their service , which can sometimes be lame . <sssss> everything is ordered at the counter -lrb- no waiter/waitress -rrb- and sometimes there is no one to be found when you need something else . <sssss> they can also be a pain to deal with if they mess up your order . <sssss> today we ordered a side of guacamole & we specifically asked for it on the side . <sssss> instead , they put a small amount of guac inside our breakfast quesadilla . <sssss> when i tried to get a side after the fact due to their screwup , they gave me some flack . <sssss> try to improve your customer service a bit sylvia 's .
LOW		we visited the rose & crown on a lovely sunday afternoon this past weekend and sat on the porch -lrb- http://twitpic.com/3ztjw -rrb- . <sssss> the pub is located in heritage square , across ye olde roade from pizza bianco . <sssss> it is an old house that has been transformed into a bar/grill . <sssss> we did not try the food . <sssss> they have a good selection of brews , but all beers are $ 5.50 -lrb- or more ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> overall we just were n't that impressed with the place and will opt for other bars when we 're in the area .
MID		we stopped in wy-knot cafe this weekend as we had heard they have some vegan options . <sssss> the entire experience was great ! <sssss> we had some delicious seared tofu sandwiches -lrb- they press extra firm tofu , cut it thin and quick fry it to make it crispy -rrb- , a super tasty vegetable soup , a beet salad , a side of breakfast potatoes and a couple of iced lattes with almond milk . <sssss> the service was good and the owner was very friendly and chatted with us about her vegan options and food . <sssss> we 'll be back ! <sssss> ca n't wait to try their tofu scramble and their tlt -lrb- tempeh lettuce tomato -rrb- sandwich . <sssss> note : they do not have any vegan butter/margarine , nor do they have any vegenaise . <sssss> hope they start carrying those both soon !
LOW		time for a review update ... my initial `` oh-my-god-there 's - a-vegan-restaurant-a-mile-from-my-house '' infatuation is now over . <sssss> i live very close to lh , so i go there a lot . <sssss> loving hut is pretty good , they have some very tasty dishes -lrb- spicy cha cha , bbq bagutte are some of my favs -rrb- and they have some not so great dishes . <sssss> the real reason for my drop-down in stars is that it 's always a pain in the arse to order what you want at loving hut . <sssss> you would think that a vegan restaurant would be totally okay with substitutions , omissions , etc -lrb- as that 's what vegans must do at most restaurants -rrb- , but no , it 's always a royal pain at loving hut . <sssss> the other day my wife wanted to try the `` tuno '' -lrb- faux tuna -rrb- sandwich on the baguette roll instead of sliced bread . <sssss> i called in to place a phone order and tried to order it . <sssss> i made it clear that i would be happy to pay a bit extra for the baguette bread if necessary . <sssss> did n't matter . <sssss> they would not do it . <sssss> no way , no how . <sssss> i tried to bargain with the phone employee who blamed it on someone else and said she had to go `` check with the cook '' if it was possible . <sssss> how would it not be possible to use a different type of bread that they already have ? <sssss> either way , they would not budge at all . <sssss> so i could n't get what i wanted , very annoying and frustrating . <sssss> i 've also tried other substitutions and dish modifications and it 's always a pain . <sssss> they no longer give free refills on iced tea -lrb- citing costs -rrb- , which is disappointing . <sssss> one day i asked about the complementary appetizer soups that they give in store , asking if i could get it for to go orders . <sssss> the employee i spoke with explained that they do n't give it out on to go orders because of soup container costs , but if i brought in my own soup container they 'd be happy to give me some . <sssss> so the next time i placed a to go order , i brought in a little plastic soup bowl and requested some . <sssss> they barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it . <sssss> bottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching , as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back . <sssss> changing up the menu by offering unique , limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place , as much of the menu seems to be very similar -lrb- the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything -rrb- . <sssss> hoping they can improve ...
LOW		we get breakfast burrito 's from caramba 's occasionally and they are pretty good . <sssss> our standard b-fasturrito order is eggs/potato/cheese . <sssss> my burrito of choice just seems a wee bit too pricey at this spot , at $ 5 a pop . <sssss> caramba 's cooks up everything good , including the taters and their red hot sauce is tasty . <sssss> they 've got a salsa bar on site too for scooping up some additional toppings of goodness . <sssss> we like the place , but we 're still looking for that perfect breakfast burrito near our neighborhood .
MID		disclaimer : i am a vegetarian . <sssss> today i checked out the newly opened loving hut on 35th ave & union hills in north phoenix . <sssss> the food was fantastic . <sssss> i ordered the ny `` steak '' combo -lrb- pic : http://twitpic.com/3qbwy -rrb- , which came with a soup of the day -lrb- very tasty vegetable soup -rrb- , rice -lrb- brown or white -rrb- , some side veggies -lrb- cabbage , carrots , snap peas -rrb- and eggplant with tofu . <sssss> the eggplant with tofu was very good , the skin was not chewy at all like in many other eggplant dishes , it almost melted in my mouth and it was very tasty . <sssss> the actual ny `` steak '' was more like a crispy faux chicken , but it was still pretty good and came with a curry dipping sauce . <sssss> they also have a wide variety of other food menu items . <sssss> the drink menu is also impressive . <sssss> many fresh made juices , smoothies , teas , etc. . <sssss> i opted for a not-so-exotic jasmine iced tea and added some organic brown sugar found on the counter . <sssss> my entire meal including my drink was about $ 9 and left me with a full belly . <sssss> plates range around $ 6 - $ 10 . <sssss> the only downside i saw with this place is the `` supermastertv '' , which is playing on two ~ 42 '' plasmas hanging on opposite walls of the dining room . <sssss> the channel is playing animal rights groups & animal cruelty content nonstop . <sssss> to be clear , i have no problem with advocating no harm to animals , but i do n't want to see slaughterhouse videos and animal abuse footage while i am eating . <sssss> i would be much more comfortable if they played some other non-graphic content there . <sssss> overall i was very satisfied and i will be turning this into a regular lunch & dinner spot .
MID		we love the improv . <sssss> we go here all the time , most recently to see jim breuer -lrb- who was absolutely hilarious -rrb- . <sssss> if you have n't been to the tempe improv , then you might not be a fan of comedy . <sssss> obviously , your experience will vary depending upon who the performing comedian is and how funny he/she is , but for the most part , the improv gets some pretty hilarious individuals passing through . <sssss> the venue itself is a relatively small `` theater '' , which means that you wo n't be straining your eyes to see the performer no matter where you sit . <sssss> as far as seat recommendations go , we always try to get a front row spot on the balcony , which provides a great view and a non-cramped seating arrangement -lrb- the table seating is cramped -rrb- . <sssss> a few things keep me from giving the improv 5 stars . <sssss> 1 -rrb- the 2 drink minimum is lame . <sssss> 2 -rrb- they do n't serve their draft beer upstairs , which means that i ca n't order a fat tire and i have to downgrade to drinking newcastle 's , which i really do n't like very much . <sssss> 3 -rrb- they are super agro about cameras & photos . <sssss> absolutely no photos are allowed . <sssss> even a grainy , blurry , camera phone snap will incur the wrath of the wait staff . <sssss> we 're huge fans of standup comedy , so we 'll keep going back to the improv for more and more , but i just wish they had a good beer available in the balcony area .
MID		if you 're a beer lover , you 'll love papago brewing company ! <sssss> with approximately 30 beers on tap and hundreds more in their fridge wall , papago has a beer for everyone . <sssss> the tap beer selection is also rotated weekly , with new , special and seasonal brews making their appearance all the time . <sssss> the inside decor is also very cool , lots of wooden , log cabin-esque seating and decorations , with hundreds of different tap handles stored in the overhead wooden beams . <sssss> if you want to play a game of darts , they 've also got you covered with 2 dartboards near the entrance . <sssss> downsides to the place include that there is no `` free '' music playing nonstop . <sssss> to get some good tunes , you 'll have to pay up to the juke box monster , which can be pricey -lrb- i paid $ 1 for one song last time -rrb- . <sssss> you 'll also want to get some music going because the place can get very loud with people talking when the place is crowded . <sssss> the food is decent , we enjoy the beer bites and the pizzas . <sssss> downside is that food is n't served all night , so get your order in before the kitchen closes . <sssss> overall , if you enjoy a wide selection of good beers and a casual place to hang out , definitely check out papago brewing company with some friends .
HIG		the employees are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious ! <sssss> we love this place ! <sssss> the roasted beet & brussel sprout salad is so good that we find ourselves craving it routinely -lrb- sans cheese , obviously -rrb- ! <sssss> they are very happy to answer my questions on ingredients , omit cheese & other items from predetermined dishes and even substitute extra items -lrb- like pine nuts -rrb- at no cost . <sssss> very vegan friendly establishment ! <sssss> other food that we enjoy there : the pizza crust bread -lrb- vegan -rrb- , pasta primavera using either a garlic olive oil sauce or a marinara sauce , with pine nuts added . <sssss> if you 're looking for some tasty italian food and excellent service , check out babbo .
MID		love , love , love that they have a new vegan menu ! <sssss> scramble has all the options down pat , they 've even got 4 vegan breakfast entrées , some great loose leaf teas , fresh made oj , soy milk , various flavors of hot sauces and more . <sssss> their outdoor patio is rad . <sssss> they 're pet and kid friendly . <sssss> i also highly appreciate the fact that they use separate cookware and plates for their vegan dishes . <sssss> my biggest problem with scramble is their consistency . <sssss> the food just does n't come out the same way every time . <sssss> my first visit to try the tofu/soyrizo burrito resulted in a burrito that was extra oily and sweet potato hash that was blackened -lrb- burnt -rrb- and extra oily . <sssss> my next visit -lrb- today -rrb- resulted in a burrito with tofu that was n't cooked/seasoned as well as the last time -lrb- big chunks of white tofu -rrb- . <sssss> the sweet potato hash was good this time . <sssss> i 'd also like to see a bit more soyrizo added to the burritos . <sssss> the miniature cup of salsa provided with these dishes should also be increased in size , as it 's easy to run through in a few bites . <sssss> i still really dig the place , i just hope that they get their cooking/prep down so that the dishes turn out more consistent and better . <sssss> i 'd also like to see a vegan brizza -lrb- breakfast pizza -rrb- added to the menu -lrb- with tofu instead of egg -rrb- .
MID		nice ! <sssss> an excellent indian food restaurant in my hood . <sssss> the food is delish , the staff is super friendly and the decor is appropriate . <sssss> we enjoyed the garlic naan , a peas & cottage cheese dish and a cauliflower & potato dish . <sssss> all were super tasty . <sssss> lots of vegetarian options . <sssss> i 'm really glad we popped in to try this place out . <sssss> we 'll be back .

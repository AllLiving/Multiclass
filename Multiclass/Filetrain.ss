MID		i have been eager to try this place for a while and we finally went here for dinner the other night . <sssss> it is a small restaurant with a nice charm . <sssss> although , for the prices i would expect a little fancier atmosphere . <sssss> for dinner we ordered the fuego seafood chile relleno . <sssss> the dish was tasty with a bit a kick . <sssss> since most of the dish was spicy it was served with a side of candied cabbage . <sssss> i 've never had that before ... it was quite interesting and a fun contrast to the spiciness of everything else . <sssss> i ordered the dragonberry mojito . <sssss> they have awards for their mojito 's so i was expecting a lot . <sssss> it was good but i would have preferred a little less mint and a little more dragonberry . <sssss> but it was still good . <sssss> overall i enjoyed the experience and am glad i finally got to try it .
HIG		i love bringing newbies to a place i know they are going to truly love . <sssss> such was tonight . <sssss> first , our watier , shawn , was amazing . <sssss> our guest likes to have the waiter pick their favorites for him and shawn stepped up to the plate ! <sssss> we started with my recommendation of the creamy , mouth-watering bone marrow . <sssss> but shawn 's pick , the green chili pork papusa was the table favorite . <sssss> then came the entrees . <sssss> i had a tender flat iron steak , my hubby had the trout , our kids had the flat iron steak and the pork belly and our guest had the sand dabs . <sssss> all of us were happy with our picks but most of all , we loved our sides . <sssss> we pushed them all in the middle of the table so we could share . <sssss> i had baby beets that were topped with an amazing sprinkle of cilantro , jalepeno and cashews , hubby had a roasted cauliflower with a curry sauce that melted in our mouths but shawn 's pick was the favorite of the table - dates with goat cheese and a sweet vinagrette that popped in your mouth when you took a swig of red wine -lrb- az stronghold magnus on tap - way to support our local wineries ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> next came a round of shots with infused fruit in the middle . <sssss> nice touch ! <sssss> then came the desserts and we were all very quiet as we ate . <sssss> i also do n't remember anyone wanting to share . <sssss> from a tantallizing , sweet creme brulee with banana , frozen raspberry , pretzel ice cream to shawn 's pick of navel orange sorbet doused with liquid nitrogen ... the presentation was incredible . <sssss> suffice it to say , this was an incredible experience ... we loved shawn . <sssss> and we ca n't wait to come back to try sunday brunch , lunch or just sit up at the bar . <sssss> the staff is so nice , we would just want sit and drink and relax . <sssss> we will be back !
HIG		omg ... i 'll start at the beginning . <sssss> waiting at the bar at this cute little house -lrb- used to be sophie 's bistro -rrb- for the maceachern 's to arrive . <sssss> our bartender , rachel , was so helpful , knowledgeable , cute , had us try litte cherry bomb shooters ... shots of vodka with a little cherry drop inside that explodes in your mouth . <sssss> their signature drinks were amazing as well . <sssss> thanks , rachel ! <sssss> then on to our table with our wonderful waitress , jessica . <sssss> all i can say is , we sat outside on this beautiful evening trying the most outlandish , unique , savory dishes . <sssss> first they bring you home made biscuits with honey butter . <sssss> then we shared thrice fried fries -lrb- say that five times fast -rrb- with three dipping sauces and -lrb- are you ready -rrb- garlic toast dipped in bone marrow -lrb- t was buttery , savory , mmmm -rrb- . <sssss> i had the parsnip soup ... so rich and creamy . <sssss> my entree was amy 's bolognese ... a garlic bread pudding with a bolognese sauce made w/beef & veal & tomatoes . <sssss> my hjusband had sand dabs and roasted brussel sprouts . <sssss> my son had a flat iron steak that melted in your mouth . <sssss> the presentation by the entire staff as they placed the dinners on our table was awesome . <sssss> but the best part was the peanut butter creme brulee with pretzels & banana ice cream . <sssss> binks is an adventure in the middle of phoenix . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back .
MID		i 've never seen so many beers in my life . <sssss> and try the tacos stuffed with mashed sweet potatoes , green chilis and cheese . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> the place was packed on a saturday afternoon and now i know why . <sssss> so many more things to try on our next visit and definitely a lot more beer to try ! <sssss> i loved my beer , its # 31 ... some pilsner thing . <sssss> perfect for me .
MID		this is such a divine little neighborhood place . <sssss> the peach white sangria really hits the spot on a warm day . <sssss> the outside area is perfect for friends and listening to music . <sssss> try the crab tapas -lrb- yum -rrb- and the brie soup -lrb- even yummier -rrb- .
HIG		i just ca n't way enough about the service , food , and general ambience . <sssss> besides being warmly greeted by the owner , we had a perfecf table to show our guests -lrb- who used to own their own restaurant -rrb- what we 've been raving about . <sssss> and they are raving as well . <sssss> today we had rusty , the laid back waiter , who was wonderful ! <sssss> and the food ... all is know is , you have to try the hapu -lrb- hawaiian fish -rrb- lemongrass encrusted with slaw and rice . <sssss> i practically licked the plate . <sssss> and guess what i found out ... the ice cream shop next door , twirl , is co-owned by dana so you can walk over and bring it back to your table . <sssss> thanks again for making this a great evening .
HIG		our waitress , kate , outdid herself once again . <sssss> she was so attentive and took care of our out of town guests . <sssss> the place was hopping but she still made us feel like we were the only table she was attending . <sssss> yummy food ... but now i understand why they call them spicy edamames . <sssss> wow !
MID		let me start out by saying that my only critique and the only reason i did n't give them five stars , is i made reservations on open table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant , they put us in the bar . <sssss> but , i have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent , the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful . <sssss> i had their 16th st short rib stew -lrb- and kuddos that you have a small portion option -rrb- and it was scrumptious . <sssss> i practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when i do n't offer to have anyone taste my dish . <sssss> it had been a long time since we were there and i doubt if it will be a long time before we go back .
MID		ok ... hot cheese , pretzels and shreiner sausage ... not a bad start to a scrumptious meal . <sssss> had a delicious fish sandwich with a chopped kale salad . <sssss> who knew that something that is natures scrub brush could taste so good . <sssss> the staff is nice , but not over the top . <sssss> i think they 're too busy to give that personal touch ... but they were attentive .
MID		yummy , yummy . <sssss> watermelon , goat cheese and heirloom tomato salad . <sssss> and a very helpful waiter that guided us through a culinary delight . <sssss> dave matthews dreaming tree chardonnay and mahi mahi tacos . <sssss> mmmmm .
LOW		will definitely have to go back for another try . <sssss> we hit it on a tuesday ... they were packed and not prepared for the crowd . <sssss> one waiter for both inside and outside . <sssss> the misters outside were pooling on my table . <sssss> the food was amazing . <sssss> we had the shaking beef and i tried everyone 's spring rolls and pho . <sssss> the lychee mojito yummy . <sssss> it was a good sign to be so busy ... but ... hope they learn by their mistakes . <sssss> i would love to go back and sit inside . <sssss> it was so cute in there . <sssss> have a feeling i could rate it 5 stars if i could sit inside . <sssss> ps : we had to park across 7th st. . <sssss> . <sssss> their private lot in the back was full and a cab blocked our way to get through it .
MID		girls night at smashburger . <sssss> who knew we would have such a great time , eat great food and have an awesome manager , chris , who made our experience even better . <sssss> once again , my vegie black bean burger with grilled onions and a fried egg on a multigrain bun was perfectly done . <sssss> the veggie frittes , too . <sssss> and a ice cold landshark beer in an ice cold frosty mug . <sssss> perfect night . <sssss> their staff kept checking with our rambunctious group , making sure we had what we needed and taking dirty plates away . <sssss> always a plus for me . <sssss> and thanks to the lady at the next booth who climbed on the table to take a picture for us . <sssss> we will be back again next month . <sssss> hope chris is ready for us !
LOW		grappled with the numbers of stars here . <sssss> 3 means a-ok ... well the food was but if i could rate the service separately it would barely get one . <sssss> dirty tables , messed up orders , inattentive staff . <sssss> and this time , there were only five of us . <sssss> on the plus side , my black burger tasted great ... once i got eat it . <sssss> they messed up on the bun and by the time they brought me the correct bun -lrb- no sauce -rrb- my friends were almost done eating . <sssss> the lady behind us had undercooked chicken . <sssss> come on ! <sssss> bring back chris , the awesome manager . <sssss> they were even out of my favorite beer : -lrb-
MID		another tini tuesday at fez although the price has gone up $ 1 since last year . <sssss> but definitely still worth the price . <sssss> our waiter , austin , was helpful and fun and his dimples did n't hurt either . <sssss> i had their go green pasta and added gyro strips to make it a delicatable greek feast . <sssss> i practically licked the bowl . <sssss> this time yelpers , we received a free appetizer of lettuce wraps by checking in with my yelp app . <sssss> loved it . <sssss> do n't know why we waited so long to go back ... will definitely be back sooner this time .
HIG		i do n't know where to start on the food experience here . <sssss> fried macaroni & cheese balls , shrimp and grits . <sssss> it was bliss ! <sssss> and what a kitchy place . <sssss> the artwork and rebar hangings were extraordinary . <sssss> our server , michelle -lrb- two l 's like me -rrb- was so patient and helpful . <sssss> she was one busy lady but kept checking back with our table . <sssss> i agree with rebecca r. . <sssss> . <sssss> please go there and help keep this place open 4ever ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back again .
HIG		might be my new favorite place to hang out on central , be a part of the `` scene '' and eat some really great food . <sssss> the staff was friendly and helpful . <sssss> my hawaiian margarita was awesome . <sssss> too bad i was the dd ... one was not enough . <sssss> everyone at the table had something unique and different and we all loved it . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back and try something else . <sssss> it was scrumptious !
MID		try the watermelon agua fresca , vodka and vanilla mint syrup . <sssss> what a cool refreshment on a hot phoenix day . <sssss> and its only $ 5.00 . <sssss> our waitress was attentive and helpful . <sssss> and the brown bag chicken sandwich was yummy . <sssss> really wanted to try a side of mac n cheese , but opted for the chopped kale salad . <sssss> what a nice surprise . <sssss> healthy and tasty .
MID		love the chips and salsa . <sssss> have been a fan of this place for eons . <sssss> but sure wish our server would have told us about the specials . <sssss> mahi tacos ... my favorite . <sssss> did n't see it until we were walking out the door .
HIG		this is the first time that i have given 5 stars to a restaurant . <sssss> but , they so deserve it . <sssss> our waitress , jill , was so wonderful and helpful . <sssss> her recommendations were spot on . <sssss> i loved everything about the place . <sssss> from the most amazing jalapeno cheddar grits to the banana split we shared for dessert . <sssss> the manager made many stops by our table to be sure everything was to our liking ... and it was . <sssss> i wish we lived in the neighborhood . <sssss> it would definitely become my neighborhood haunt .
MID		its been almost a year since i 've been to timo and do n't know why i waited so long . <sssss> it was another near perfect lunch with a delightful waiter - thanks robbie - and one of the best bloody mary 's i 've ever had . <sssss> it was garnished with asparagus , olives and shaved paremsan and it was perfectly seasoned . <sssss> yum ! <sssss> had the timo trio which includes your choice of soup -lrb- went with the butternut squash this time -rrb- , salad dressed with cranberries and bacon , and the sandwich of the day on a delicious roll . <sssss> it was a perfect day to sit out on the back patio . <sssss> do n't think i 'll wait so long for my next trip .
MID		we decided to give them one more chance . <sssss> and i am so glad we did . <sssss> first of all , i commend the owner , candy , for responding to my previous yelp and coming to talk to us tonight at dinner . <sssss> she is a warm , friendly , lovely lady and i am so glad to have met her . <sssss> our server , amy , was great ... even before she knew we had put something negative on yelp . <sssss> the last time must have been an off time . <sssss> like my first time , it was awesome . <sssss> the menu is so eclectic , with a phillipine flavor . <sssss> their homemade brews ... tasty and refreshing ... and each one compliments the food on the menu . <sssss> canadian , french , english , phillipine , chicago dogs , kobe burgers , vegeteratian pizzas , something for everyone . <sssss> and the vanilla malts ... made from the malt used in their beers . <sssss> omg . <sssss> this is definitely a family run , work of art , place that needs to be supported . <sssss> you have won me back !
MID		not much to add to my review from july . <sssss> i had the same dinner , the same drink . <sssss> love it ... love it . <sssss> keep the margs and warm tortilla chips coming !
LOW		i had rated this four stars last time . <sssss> although i enjoyed the dinner -lrb- pasta puglio is my favorite -rrb- the service was very inconsistent . <sssss> we went from sitting at the bar while we waited and having an outstanding bartender -lrb- thanks will -rrb- to a young waiter who said all the right things , went through the motions , but did n't listen to anything we said or asked for . <sssss> from bringing the main dish way before we even finished our salad to not splitting the bill , ryan was in need of some additional training . <sssss> again , the food is consistently good . <sssss> and i expect a wait on spaghetti & meatball night , but i also expect consistent service . <sssss> sorry . <sssss> maybe next time .
LOW		its a fun little place . <sssss> awesome french toast and since we were splitting our breakfast , they made sure they gave us everything on separate plates . <sssss> the staff was attentive and helpful . <sssss> food good ... just something about the place does n't knock my socks off . <sssss> i think i just like to come in , sit down and have someone bring me my menu and coffee .
HIG		lumpia , pork belly , everything filipino and did you know they will do private parties as well . <sssss> they will pull up in your driveway and give your party the best food , experience and fun . <sssss> follow them on facebook , go where the food trucks or go , or just have them over . <sssss> they are amazing , loving people , too . <sssss> still not sure i 'm ready to try the pig face ... maybe next time .
MID		yo adrian ! <sssss> you are the best waiter ! <sssss> you made us three lovely ladies feel welcome . <sssss> we loved your recommendations , too . <sssss> let 's talk creamy brie soup infused with truffle oil . <sssss> and the spicy copa with burrato cheese brushcetta was the perfect blend of cheese and spicy . <sssss> washing it down with sangria was so nice , too . <sssss> and after our leisurly lunch , we we just in time to go outside and start happy hour ! <sssss> $ 5 for any glass of wine . <sssss> perfect way to spend an afternoon chatting with the girls . <sssss> thanks , adrian ... good luck on your weight challenge !
HIG		i rarely give a restaurant five stars on my first visit , but i 'd go higher here if i could ! <sssss> what an experience ! <sssss> you definitely have to know where you are going . <sssss> the teeter house has so many memories for me and this is such a cute little house . <sssss> you feel like home . <sssss> all the servers and staff were so attentive and helpful in explaining these unique japanese out of the ordinary dishes . <sssss> and try things we did ! <sssss> from dishes off the cold plates served on tiny spoons -lrb- you have to try the grapefruit and hamachi - omg -rrb- with flavors that exploded in your mouth to perfectly cooked lamb chops and yellow tail . <sssss> our sous chef , chris , was a delightful addition to our table , explaining every detail of the execution and flavors and was an excellent saleman as well . <sssss> instead of a rich , creamy dessert , we opted for one more round of shabu shabu . <sssss> it was an experience in itself . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and to take others to be able to savor and smile as things explode on your taste buds . <sssss> thanks for a great evening !
MID		so those of you who know me , know i go for `` quirky '' . <sssss> quirky movies , quirky books , quirky hair ... and this place fits right into that mode . <sssss> it 's nestled on 12th st just south of thomas in the coronado neighborhood district and actually drove by it twice before stopping . <sssss> but i 'm so glad to have found it . <sssss> the cutest , ecclectic place , cute patio -lrb- but its 112 today so i looked through the window -rrb- and a great healthy ecclectic menu . <sssss> we went for lunch . <sssss> my friends each had a sandwich that was flavorful and different and i opted for the mexican gyro . <sssss> tender , melt in your mouth green chili pork on a pita -lrb- a tad hard to eat -rrb- . <sssss> they have a wonderful drink menu and found out that my favorite , hard to find beer -lrb- dixie new orleans beer -rrb- is sold from 5 -6 pm for $ 3 ! <sssss> scrumptious desserts , too . <sssss> i will definitely have to to go back and also try their sister dinner restaurant next door , the tuck shop . <sssss> again , this is n't your normal lunch , brunch place . <sssss> you have to go up and order and they bring it to your table -lrb- which i 'm not always a fan of -rrb- but i 'll give them the beneift here ... its worth it .
MID		was here for dinner monday and back again on sunday ! <sssss> i love the food and the choices . <sssss> our waiter was friendly and patient with this group of 5 women and i loved my pasta puglio . <sssss> monday i had roasted brussel sprouts and pancetta over pasta . <sssss> both were excellent and i definitely did n't need a doggie bag . <sssss> monday i had the white sangria , today the red . <sssss> both were yummy . <sssss> great specials and happy hours but do n't go online to read about them because this babbo does n't always have them same as the others . <sssss> and kudos to the warm herb bread and dipping oil .
MID		brought another friend to share in this family run place . <sssss> she loved it as much as i do . <sssss> a great array of brews ... i am partial to the lager . <sssss> she loved the fruity pomegranate brew . <sssss> we split a yummy , tangy kale salad , an order of pretzel bread , a bbq chicken flatbread and my favorite , lumpia , a phillipine type egg roll . <sssss> there was a band playing on stage ... a group of old guys who really did a great grateful dead set ... not too loud , just right . <sssss> its a nice , comfy , family run , neighborhood place ... you should try it .
MID		excited to go to another upward projects place as positinos and windsor are already a favorite . <sssss> great thin crust ... and lots of unique toppings . <sssss> all the servers seemed to help each other out and were attentive , tho , no personal touch . <sssss> busy , hopping , great location and food , tho . <sssss> i will go again .
LOW		i 've been waiting for a new moon valley hangout since basis closed . <sssss> this could possibly be the place . <sssss> a tad confusing if you 're used to market bistro being there but once inside , you realize this is no salad bar place . <sssss> we greeted by a friendly hostess and then approached by our attentive waitress . <sssss> a great beer & wine list . <sssss> our sandwiches were yummy . <sssss> ambience very nice , trendy but in a good way . <sssss> the price ... hmmmm . <sssss> that 's where it was definitely similar to basis ... it wasy pricey . <sssss> hope they have a good happy hour menu on their plate . <sssss> it could be a wonderful place for the community to go and have everybody know your name . <sssss> i will definitely try again .
MID		you got ta love tini tuesdays ! <sssss> $ 3 martinis that are the bomb ... especially the cherry bomb . <sssss> and if you subscribe to yelp , you can get special deals . <sssss> yesterday i had an awesome seared scallop appetizer for $ 8.95 that was n't on the menu ... only special customers enjoyed this savory treat . <sssss> the waiters are almost as delicious as the food . <sssss> our waiter , with a belt bucklet labeled `` cocky '' definitely was and treated all of us old ladies like we were queens -lrb- ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> great times , great location , great food .
LOW		so my first impression was that this was a yuppie urban chipotle 's only more confusing since the menu was written over head instead of behind the servers which is ten times easier . <sssss> but , the beef short rib enchilada was so good and the choices of toppings -lrb- cheeses , vegies , etc -rrb- were so much better . <sssss> and they top it off by baking it in a cute little clay dish in the oven . <sssss> it was yummy ! <sssss> the chips , however ... much better at chipotles . <sssss> i will definitely go back for lunch soon and try some of the other interesting dishes ... probably not for dinner .
MID		thanks su vino for contributing to a wonderful afternoon with my goddaughter . <sssss> she is an unemployed bartender who recently relocated to phoenix . <sssss> she needed some instruction on wines to complete her resume . <sssss> we purchased a groupon for a wine flight and appetizers . <sssss> i was leery after reading some of the reviews . <sssss> all i can say is they bent over backwards to assist us , explain things , answer questions , and make this a totally enjoyable experience . <sssss> kudos to our server , jackie , who really made melanie feel special . <sssss> their recommendations were spot on . <sssss> and the glass of bubbly on the house did n't hurt , either .
HIG		thanks kate for being a fabulous waitress . <sssss> this was the perfect end to our day . <sssss> our group had one diner that has very special food needs and she was perfect in suggestions , moderations , guiding him along . <sssss> and this time , i was n't the dd -lrb- i asked for you dana -rrb- so the lucious passion fruit margs flowed . <sssss> and my dinner was the best ! <sssss> lemongrass encrusted hapu -lrb- hawaiian sea bass -rrb- was done to perfection . <sssss> only bummer ... it was raining and we could n't sit outside . <sssss> next time !
LOW		already lowered my raing ... hopefully a fluke on a bad day ... but brought two friends to the place i 'd been raving about and all they kept saying is `` i hope you put this on yelp '' . <sssss> we opted to sit outside altho it was a hot phoenix day and i think that may have thrown the staff out as it was like pulling teeth trying to get water , napkins , etc. . <sssss> it was happy hour when we got there , but a good server would of let us know when it was close to ending so we could replenish with another drink so when the bill came and we saw the difference in price of our beers , we were a tad put off . <sssss> one diner ordered a flatbread pizza , the other a burger . <sssss> we think our server decided to hold off serving the burger till the pizza was ready as the burger and fries were cold . <sssss> they did replace it but no attempt to adjust the bill or add a dessert or drink . <sssss> just an ` i 'm sorry '' which i suppose is better than nothing . <sssss> i am willing to give it one more try to see if we just hit it on an off day . <sssss> i hope so . <sssss> food is tasty and my friend who enjoys a good craft beer absolutely loved her choice . <sssss> she called it fruit salad beer . <sssss> we 'll see .
MID		always love an honest to god good diner ! <sssss> nothing fancy here . <sssss> but the food is yummy . <sssss> try the biscuits and gravy . <sssss> mmmmmmm . <sssss> and the service was friendly and competent . <sssss> we will be back for more !
HIG		three of us locals went to try a restaurant we had never been to before and came out wondering how come we did n't find this place before ! <sssss> the service was impeccable ... from the hostess to our waitress to the manager . <sssss> everyone was friendly and helpful . <sssss> we ordered the guacomole that is prepared tableside and we practically licked the bowl . <sssss> the posole and kobe dog hit the spot on a chilly afternoon . <sssss> the manager , michelle , stopped by our table and after some facebook discussion , sent us three small avocado margeritas to taste . <sssss> omg ! <sssss> i ca n't wait to spread the word about this place and i know my boys will love the kobe dog . <sssss> ca n't wait to go again soon !
MID		celebrating my husband 's birthday at a very wonderful , unusual , urban place . <sssss> i really wanted to give it a 41/2 but will wait for the next visit and pretty sure it would get 5 stars . <sssss> atmosphere & ambience is very cool ... outdoor ping pong tables , shuffleboard , fire pits outside or sit inside and you still get the same flavor . <sssss> great waiter , helpful , attentive . <sssss> but most of all , great menu . <sssss> we started with their antipasto board with an array of choices ... meats , cheeses , hardboiled eggs , roasted aspargus , beets . <sssss> what a great way to start . <sssss> the bistro steak on a bed of melted gorgonzola was mouth-watering . <sssss> and hot carmel monkey bread with apple filling and vanilla bean ice cream , on the house , to end the birthday celebration . <sssss> ca n't wait to go back .
MID		the greene house hit the spot last night - its hard to get hubby to try new places and honestly we 've been budget conscious about going out to eat lately , so we really want to make sure we 'll go someplace we 'll really enjoy . <sssss> luckily , hubby liked it , and we were happy with our experience . <sssss> i only give this place 4 stars because they are n't kid friendly -lrb- a little pricey and no kids ' options on the menu -rrb- , and the service was pretty slow , but even at that , the server was very friendly . <sssss> we sat out on the patio as the sun was going down - the place had a nice atmosphere and it was just nice to sit , people watch and enjoy the weather . <sssss> we started with the herbed hummus and i got the twin kobe burgers with fries - they were pretty decent , nothing out of the ordinary . <sssss> however , hubby got the mahi tacos and they were outstanding , as was the side of mac cheese we got for my son . <sssss> i do n't think i 'd order the same food , but i would definitely go again for a date night !
HIG		stumbled upon this place last night -lrb- during first friday -rrb- and could n't find a sign or the name until we saw a poster hanging inside . <sssss> cool house that was built in the 20 's , with the dj up top in the loft -lrb- music was great -rrb- , lots of great art on the walls and the bar has been built into where the kitchen of the house was . <sssss> they were totally packed and coud n't even get out to the back but it was really fun . <sssss> everyone was friendly and having fun . <sssss> the website says they offer 80 + beers , we had blue moons and some others i 'd never seen before -lrb- which is always cool ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> highly recommended , especially for first friday - the artists selling their works , jewelry , handmade goods , purses , sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the lost leaf , and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the az center -lrb- great place to park if you do n't get downtown early -rrb- .
LOW		went for my sister 's birthday dinner last night . <sssss> i like the atmosphere there and the service was pretty good . <sssss> but i always think to myself that they are just a bit overpriced and the food just misses the mark of being great -lrb- i got the navajo sandwhich , it just kind of fell apart and was stuffed with really thick slices of underipe tomato that was white in the middle . <sssss> fries were cold -rrb- . <sssss> we ordered the kids ' pasta for my son and it was just that - a bowl of way too hot pasta -lrb- i just do n't know why restaurants serve kids ' meals at 1000 degrees -rrb- . <sssss> but that was it , just pasta , no veggies or sides . <sssss> it is a family place no matter what they try to be , it is a big loud place that people bring their kids to , is it too much to ask for a nice , healthy meal for my kid ? <sssss> but i digress . <sssss> again , loved the service but the food was underwhelming . <sssss> luckily i really enjoyed spending time with my family and that made it fun : -rrb-
HIG		the herb box provided us one of the best restaurant experiences we 've had in a very long time . <sssss> the herb box on pima in dc market ranch is really beautiful , warm and comfortable . <sssss> it has a smaller deli kind of section , a larger dining room and outdoor patio area . <sssss> we sat outside under the heaters and were treated to a great experience . <sssss> first , our waiter was really great . <sssss> he had a great personality , was very attentive , and had lots of great recommendations for us . <sssss> i started with a blackberry mojito - it had a very distinctive and strong flavor , but i liked it quite a bit . <sssss> i am not a big fan of mint but found that the blackberry mellowed the mint . <sssss> it went down easy ! <sssss> hubby got the steak and gorgonzola salad , and listened to him talk about how great it was with every bite ! <sssss> i also got to try the trout which was seasoned and cooked to perfection . <sssss> i ordered some appetizers for my dinner including the brown sugar and jerk pulled pork sliders , cheesed stuffed fried olives and the falafel plate . <sssss> i enjoyed all of it , seriously i ate until i could n't anymore . <sssss> the fried olive were frickin incredible , i 've never had anything like them . <sssss> the green olives were a bit tart and full of rich creamy cheese , and finished off with a light crunchy fried batter . <sssss> i am totally thrilled with this place , it is one of my new faves and will be added to the regular rotation .
HIG		the entire team at whole foods is amazing ! <sssss> i recenly took at tour at this location with some friends -lrb- phoenixfridaynight.com -rrb- , and julie , bianca , shawn and jesus made it a memorable event ! <sssss> i did n't realize it , but everything in the store is either organic or all natural . <sssss> you can have anything in the seafood department cooked to order , anything in the meat department butchered to order . <sssss> some other little things i did n't know about whole foods - you can make fresh pressed peanut butter near the bulk foods section , there are bins with different combos -lrb- peanuts and chocolate chips , honey roasted peanuts , etc -rrb- for different flavors . <sssss> there is also a wine and tapas bar at this location and you can also ask for samples of just about anything in the store . <sssss> i plan to visit the taqueria soon -lrb- next to the sandwhich and pizza stations -rrb- . <sssss> and , i mustve walked by a thousand times and never noticed , but they have a smoothie and coffee bar at the front of the store too . <sssss> i love whole foods - i know a lot of people who say they are more expensive so they avoid it , but i think their prices have gotten a lot better . <sssss> plus , you are supporting local growers and producers . <sssss> how cool is that ?! <sssss> thanks whole foods !
MID		this is so my go to place for shoes ! <sssss> went yesterday and got the hottest pair of red patent leather peep toe cole haan heels . <sssss> they were originally $ 275 marked down to $ 99 ! <sssss> found the perfect pair but they 're a bit tight ? <sssss> purchase your shoes and take them back to the shoe counter - they 'll stretch them for you for 24 hours at no charge . <sssss> the rest of the merch is pretty hit or miss . <sssss> i sometimes find great bargains on handbags and jewelry but the makeup and bath items tend not to be priced very well -lrb- pretty average , not really `` outlet pricing '' on those items -rrb- . <sssss> you never know what you will find for clothes , sometimes things seem picked through , but once in a while you can really find a designer bargain . <sssss> highly recommended !
MID		this used to be one of my favorite restaurants : -lrb- we noticed that right after it changed hands the service was n't as good as it used to be , but when we went recently it seems to have improved . <sssss> the food has always been superb - even if you are n't a steak eater , you are going to love their steaks -lrb- aged in-house -rrb- ! <sssss> i am also a fan of the spicey mambo salad with wasabe dressing -lrb- mastro 's salad is also really good , topped with a big shrimp , mmmm -rrb- , the chilean sea bass , and my all time favorite sinful splurge has to be the gnocchi side dish with cheese , lobster and truffle oil . <sssss> oh yes . <sssss> the mastro 's potatoes are also nice and cheesy and one of my favorite sides . <sssss> the butter and lava cakes are also a nice way to top off the evening . <sssss> do n't even think about getting a seat at the bar if you go on a weekend night at 7pm -lrb- and you will probably need to call in your reservations at least a week in advance during season -rrb- , but you can do some good people watching - twenty somethings that think they are all that , ladies of the night looking for sugar daddies and sugar daddies abound ! <sssss> my father in law even ran into jenna jameson there -lrb- yes , it was an akward conversation : -rrb- they have a really nice private dining room that looks in on the kitchen -lrb- really fun to watch them hoppin ' in there ! <sssss> -rrb- , but it has recently changed - be prepared to provide a credit card and commit to a minimum for the room these days . <sssss> this is a great place for a special night out , a big celebration , or a fun place to have a nightcap after a crazy night .
MID		after a failed attempt to get lunch at extreme pita -lrb- see previous review -rrb- we walked over to bww and were pleasantly surprised . <sssss> it was our first time there and from the outside we did n't expect to find a decently cool sports bar - not a bad seat in the house , there are literally wall to wall tvs , you ca n't miss the game . <sssss> the service was phenomenal from the hostess to the server to the runners . <sssss> i even dumped my coke like a clumsy pregnant woman and a cheerful girl came over to clean it up and had the server over with a new drink in no time . <sssss> we started with a half dozen medium wings and they were very good . <sssss> i had the buffalitos and onion rings . <sssss> the rings were pretty average , and i liked the buffalitos a lot except that the flour tortillas was a bit dry/stale . <sssss> my son got the popcorn shrimp and ate every last one of them , and hubby got a chicken wrap that he liked a lot . <sssss> we will definitely be back , mainly when i 'm not pregnant and may partake in games and beer : d
HIG		went for the first time yesterday for lunch . <sssss> it was soooo good ! <sssss> there is a wine / beer bar adjacent to the main retail / deli area . <sssss> lots of unique gifts , artisanal cheeses and more ! <sssss> i was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it . <sssss> had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front -lrb- note for summer : they only have outdoor seating -rrb- . <sssss> clean , friendly and delicious , check it out !
LOW		disappointing in the sense that this had the potential to be a great experience . <sssss> cute place , nice staff , pretty patio . <sssss> oj tasted like fresh squeezed , carmel machiato was delish , food was fresh and good quality . <sssss> on the other hand , the table was wobbly and driving me crazy . <sssss> omelette came w the wrong side , no cheese and realized i never got my toast . <sssss> had to ask twice for coffee refill , and took 15 minutes to get the check which was a nightmare with kids . <sssss> could hear other tables with similar complaints , maybe an off day .
HIG		had a fabulous girls dinner here ! <sssss> i 'd never been , but one of the girls suggested it . <sssss> at first i was little leery , i have n't really had my best meals in hotel restaurants . <sssss> i was pleasantly surprised . <sssss> the place is really pretty , polished but unpretentious and comfortable with large tables and booths -lrb- the kind of place you can meet with a big group of friends and they are n't put off -rrb- , and the bar area was hoppin . <sssss> the service was very good , our waiter made great suggestions based on what we 'd like and was very attentive . <sssss> best of all was the food . <sssss> i had the caesar salad , which was decent , but the baked tomato soup was realllllllyyy good . <sssss> the flavors were delicious -lrb- sometimes tomato soup can be really acidic but my guess is that they even it out with a creamy base maybe ? <sssss> -rrb- and the potato souffle -lrb- sort of a whipped twice baked potato side -rrb- which was also really nice . <sssss> i will definitely be back , and i recommend it !
LOW		went with friends for lunch last week . <sssss> i 've never been - the atmosphere is fun , the place is huge and has an large outdoor seating area . <sssss> its like a macayos on steroids . <sssss> anyway , the food was good , and the service would good also . <sssss> except for when my friend wanted a simple substitution . <sssss> before we know it , 10 minutes have gone by , i 've had an entire conversation about something else with the 3rd person in our party and another staff person was brought over . <sssss> one of my friends called ordering lunch `` negotiating '' . <sssss> the poor guy gave up and ordered something else entirely . <sssss> it was good , it was just a weird experience .
HIG		i hardly ever get downtown for lunch and had no idea where to go , so i sent out a tweet . <sssss> a couple people independently suggested cibo , so we met friends there . <sssss> the place is very a charming , a converted house with brick wall , chandeliers , and cool art . <sssss> they serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time . <sssss> i got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it . <sssss> it was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking , but overall pretty good . <sssss> the bread was toasty and incredible . <sssss> the staff was great - nice , genuine and friendly . <sssss> i love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company . <sssss> last , but best , we ordered dessert crepes . <sssss> this is where the 5th star comes in - oh my freaking god . <sssss> we got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table . <sssss> we also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar . <sssss> it was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate . <sssss> let me tell you - if you ever have a hot date , or an apology to make , do it over wine and dessert crepes at cibo .
HIG		we had a fabulous time at roka akor on friday night ! <sssss> they saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice . <sssss> we met some friends early for drinks at the bar . <sssss> the service was a bit slow , but it was pretty busy . <sssss> i had a glass of wine , one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend . <sssss> we were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server -lrb- wish i could remember her name -rrb- who took the time to explain both the yelp eats menu , the regular menu and about the restaurant . <sssss> we 'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that was n't part of the yelp eats wine special but she honored it anyway . <sssss> from there on out , all i can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food ! <sssss> i had the tempura sweet potato and white fish , both were delicious - i am looking forward to going back just for them ! <sssss> next , i had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll , which were some of the best sushi i 've had in a while . <sssss> hubby 's pork chop was cooked to perfection , too . <sssss> i ca n't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere , food , price and service were great . <sssss> best of all , he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends . <sssss> we will definitely be back !
HIG		had the best best time here tonight ! <sssss> my mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and i insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me . <sssss> i 've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in . <sssss> the restaurant is beautiful - we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice . <sssss> the bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it -lrb- ala the ocean club bar -rrb- . <sssss> we has 2 rounds , including the vitamin c martini , white chocolate martini , flirtini and black cherry cocktail - they were all really great ! <sssss> we also got the colossal shrimp appetizer -lrb- which technically were n't all that colossal , they were just normal -rrb- , the sliders -lrb- the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing ! <sssss> -rrb- and the az eggrolls -lrb- a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour -rrb- . <sssss> the tab was only $ 65 -lrb- it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $ 6 / drink and app -rrb- . <sssss> the service was also extremely good . <sssss> it 's been a long time since i felt like raving about a restaurant - it was great !
HIG		this is one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons ! <sssss> the service is fantastic - roberto , the owner , and his wife susan are often at the restaurant , greeting guests and going table to table . <sssss> reservations are recommended -lrb- especially if you are going on a fri or sat night in season -rrb- , if you call ahead ask for wanda . <sssss> she is friendly and attentive , as is all the staff . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable - you will get a meal on par with mastro 's or flemings for half the price . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood , homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts -lrb- love the semifredo ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> they have consistently served fantastic food for the years my hubby and i have been going . <sssss> the wine list is extensive , you 'll be sure to find a favorite that wo n't break the bank , and do n't forget to end your meal with an espresso or limencello . <sssss> the atmosphere is great - relaxing , intimate , a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you . <sssss> also , do n't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer - they serve new dishes that are n't on the menu and are very generous with the pours .
MID		invited here for a meeting last week and really enjoyed it . <sssss> on a side note , i am surprised at how often i am getting invited to the indian school and miller area these days , lots of great little places down there . <sssss> the atmosphere is very cute , a big bright pink wall , black leather furniture and ultra chic fashion photos on another wall -lrb- one of my guests knows the owner , apparently he was the photographer ? <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the pasties in case looked really lovely , and we had very attentive service . <sssss> our food was delicious - i had the the organic carrot veloute , a smooth and delicious soup accented with ginger and cilantro . <sssss> it was served with a bed of lettuce and dressing . <sssss> the only things that didnt thrill me were the salad -lrb- is it salad or garnish ? <sssss> if its a salad a couple slices of tomato and cucumber would be nice -rrb- and the price is a bit on the high side - $ 7 for the soup . <sssss> but the overall experience was great and we 'll be back .
HIG		i love this place ! <sssss> took my son yesterday morning . <sssss> it is always clean and well organized . <sssss> you can make a day of this park with so much to do ! <sssss> the park 's hours vary with the season but typically opens at 10am . <sssss> purchase your ride at the front office as you 're walking in . <sssss> the park has a fun train ride , carousel , a huge playground and large open fields with several ramadas for parties . <sssss> you can bring in your own food for a picnic or get lunch -lrb- things like chili , pizza , pb & j -rrb- just north of the train station or visit the snack bar near the carousel -lrb- ice cream , candy , popcorn , chips , coffee beverages -rrb- . <sssss> the prices are very reasonable , especially for ramada rental . <sssss> visit , you will love this place !
MID		went to lux for the first time yesterday to grab a hot tea and get some work done . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience and i am looking forward to returning . <sssss> the people who work there are pretty cool , they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and i had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples . <sssss> awwww yeahhhh ! <sssss> i would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side , the atmosphere could be better and there are no seats at lunchtime . <sssss> i was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave . <sssss> it seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for . <sssss> at any rate , the best thing about this place is n't the place , or even the coffee and food - its the people . <sssss> the employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really , really cool . <sssss> i met 2 people there i knew from twitter who introduced me to another friend , who in turn introduced me to yet another person . <sssss> there is a great buzz in this place , lots of people thinking , working and talking all fueled by caffeine . <sssss> i had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself . <sssss> looking forward to returning .
HIG		i 'd never been to sweet republic before , but we decided to host an event here -lrb- north valley friday night -rrb- on the last friday night of june . <sssss> the owners were very friendly and welcoming . <sssss> the place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing ! <sssss> i had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream . <sssss> it sounded crazy so i had to get it , and it was really really good ! <sssss> -lrb- for the less adventurous , s r offers normal flavors too , my son had mint chocolate chip -rrb- . <sssss> the home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time i plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches - yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies . <sssss> highly recommended !!
MID		stopped by here yesterday at happy hour ! <sssss> had a late lunch so a friend i shared the carrot souflee -lrb- it was good but not quite what we were picturing , guess we should 've asked ... -rrb- and a couple glass of wine -lrb- $ 4 at happy hour ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> regularly , all the wines are $ 6/glass or $ 20/bottle , even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants . <sssss> the service was a little on the slow side , but very friendly . <sssss> also really like the atmosphere , lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm . <sssss> the outside seating area also looked really nice . <sssss> will definitely try it again for dinner soon .
LOW		had dinner here last night . <sssss> we used to go once a week and have dropped back a bit because of the service . <sssss> pj knows that the food is good and the price is right . <sssss> they pack the house even though the servers treat you more like a nuisance than a valued customer , which is why they do n't improve -lrb- and the only reason i knocked off 2 stars -rrb- . <sssss> i know they are all super-emo-cool but come on , there are lots of places to eat and the economy is bad ! <sssss> treat me like you 're happy to see me spending money in your restaurant ! <sssss> i have high hopes for the soon to open desert ridge location . <sssss> the chicken and hummus and lavosh shawarma were right on , as usual . <sssss> you might be aggravated with the staff but you wo n't be disappointed with the food . <sssss> carry out anyone ?
MID		i love this place ! <sssss> it is an really cool old school italian deli with the kinds of things my grandparents would have just loved - lots of imported groceries , gardineria , sweets and deli meats . <sssss> my absolute favorites are the italian roast beef -lrb- great sub rolls ! <sssss> -rrb- and you must get the fresh mozzarella appetizer - half moons of crispy fried mozzarella served with marinara .
LOW		heard of them before and got a postcard for a free `` floater '' -lrb- scalp massage -rrb- , and we have a salon client , so thought i 'd investigate . <sssss> overall a pleasant experience , online scheduling is easy and i got a text reminder which was nice . <sssss> it was a little hard to find them -lrb- they are n't in the s ` dale quarter directories yet -rrb- and their vm goes to a corporate number which has the loooooooongest automated message , but i found it ok after all . <sssss> i got there and gave them my postcard for the floater . <sssss> the place is very cute , i like the concept . <sssss> it was clean and bright , good music , mirrors everywhere are a bit much lol appropriately girly movie on the flatscreens , fresh flowers were happy looking , and the receptionist was cute . <sssss> they wound up forgetting my floater , which does n't seem like a big deal , but it was kind of the whole reason i went , so it sucked : -lrb- they gave me my postcard back to use again before it expires in may , which is nice , but it also means i have to get my hair done twice if i want to get a free scalp massage ... i still love my girls at my salon , but it was kind of nice to pop into a place 10 minutes from home and have them do a quick touch up and walk out feeling cute -lrb- i did get a lot of compliments -rrb- . <sssss> i 'll try it again . <sssss> i could see it being a fun place for a girls ' party : -rrb-
MID		had dinner here last night . <sssss> the atmosphere is way over the top , to the point that it kind of bugged me a little . <sssss> the walls are plastered with fake antique signs , small floral prints , painted messages and quotes - it kind of made me feel anxious . <sssss> there is also a weird gator head at the bar - it 's that kind of place . <sssss> other than that though the food was amazing . <sssss> we started with fried okra and it was awesome - nice big pieces deep fried and served with a delicious spicy mustard sauce . <sssss> hubby enjoyed the novelty of iced tea served in mason jars . <sssss> we both had bbq tri tip sandwiches which were very good and not at all greesy , and i loved the spicy bbq sauce . <sssss> i was a bit disappointed with the braised greens - they were extremely salty and devoid of flavor . <sssss> also , the server was ok enough , he just lacked any kind of enthusiasm . <sssss> all in all it was a pretty good experience and we would try it again .
HIG		had a great lunch here with my friends sherry and brandon . <sssss> the two owners -lrb- i am guessing here , but father and son ? <sssss> -rrb- were very friendly and attentive . <sssss> i had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato , and everyone else 's food looked great -lrb- a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup -rrb- . <sssss> i was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show -lrb- satellite i guess ? <sssss> -rrb- , and the great mix of locals and business people . <sssss> the market section is also great - you 'll find loads of bottled cooking oils , spices , pickles and other pickled veggies , canned eggplant , cous cous and pastas , as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods . <sssss> will definitely return !
MID		i give the desert botanical gardens 4 out of 5 stars , only because they just are n't the same as they used to be : -lrb- my hubby and i were married there almost 6 years ago , so we 've always had a special attachment to the gardens , and have been members ever since . <sssss> the paths are lovely - really a nice way to spend the day getting fresh air and sunshine , soaking up the amazingly lush succulents and cacti , bunnies , birds , and other animals . <sssss> the butterfly pavilion is also a treat when its in season , and a lot of the festivals and classes are great , as are the changing art exhibits -lrb- ca n't wait to see the chihuly exhibit !! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> the only thing that disappoints me is how freakin expensive it has gotten ! <sssss> i am totally not cheap , and i am all about supporting the non-profits , but the cost of events and memberships has gone up and up an up every year . <sssss> i start to wonder how the average family could enjoy the gardens ? <sssss> we love the agave on the rocks and luminarias events , but we may or may not go this year because the prices have just gotten outrageous , even at member-pricing . <sssss> it seems like most of the mailers we get these days are highlighting their fundraising activities and we recently got hammered with calls during a fundraising campaign . <sssss> i totally get it , its just a turn off to hear so much about the fundraising . <sssss> it just seems like they have become more preoccupied with raising funds than adding value for visitors lately . <sssss> i still love it here , a beautiful place that holds special meaning to us . <sssss> its great to bring family , out of town visitors or for dates .
MID		this is my favorite burger joint as delux has the best burgers for taste . <sssss> i 've never had a problem with the food here , only thing i find strange at times is sometimes the wait staff has a bit of an attitude , which is funny considering it 's a burger place . <sssss> i know it 's in the biltmore-arcadia area but la de da . <sssss> this last visit was funny as i saw some parents bring a bunch of children here . <sssss> this does not seem like the type of place to bring your child , totally odd , but whatever rocks your boat .
LOW		love the food , service is mixed . <sssss> we were promptly greeted , it seemed busy for a sunday night . <sssss> once we got our drinks however and stated we needed a few minutes , one was two , two was three , three was fifteen minutes later so that was a little annoying . <sssss> i wanted something new so i ordered the athenian sphagetti and i added gyo meat with it and had their salad . <sssss> we also ordered the hummus trio . <sssss> the food was awesome . <sssss> my spaghetti was great and i 'm not much of a pasta person but my choice with the add on was perfect . <sssss> i think if the place had n't been so unexpectedly busy on a sunday the service would have been a bit quicker . <sssss> i wo n't hold it agaisnt them as it is hard to find a greek food place open on sunday . <sssss> i 'll be back .
HIG		this place has a nice twist on italian . <sssss> the atmosphere is great its wide open . <sssss> you can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked , there should be an food network focus show done here ! <sssss> the lighting is wonderful , i even picked up some interior design ideas . <sssss> the food was extremely tasty , a little on the salty side , but it probably was the pruiscuitto . <sssss> the wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet . <sssss> north , i 've made a new friend , i 'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship . <sssss> fyi-this is a great date place . <sssss> it will delight your date as its not trite .
HIG		best banana walnut pancakes in the valley . <sssss> they even serve the syrup on the side nice and warm to melt the fresh butter . <sssss> tuna salad sandwich is also on my top five sandwiches . <sssss> friendly staff , free wifi and plug ins for your laptop . <sssss> could it be any better ?
LOW		i might give it one more try . <sssss> the service was fast , the sandwich was relatively good but could have been more flavorable considering the price point of this restaurant . <sssss> then came the food with a bag of plain lays potato chips . <sssss> i think subway offer more flavor for less money . <sssss> on the upside the coleslaw had an interesting twist with the feta cheese . <sssss> they could have cut it up better , looked like a shake out of the bag job . <sssss> do n't go out of your way to eat here .
MID		thanks to the wondeful folks at groupon tried caffe boa . <sssss> i had to say i am eager to return . <sssss> the decor and atmospher is very cosmo and open , there are plenty of intimate tables and those for larger groups . <sssss> our waiter was very friendly and we received our drinks within a short period of time . <sssss> we were also seated fairly quickly . <sssss> the appetizer caesar salad was ok , the bread with sauce was much better . <sssss> i liked the basket approach . <sssss> i ordered their version of the fried chicken which had a bean salad type side dish . <sssss> very very good . <sssss> i look forward to trying the brunch , i wish they had a location in central phoenix . <sssss> the music was also very urban . <sssss> i thought this was a great date dinner setting . <sssss> thanks caffe boa
LOW		frequent slow/inaccurate orders . <sssss> this is not one of the better valley locations . <sssss> metro center is the one to beat . <sssss> on my two of my three visits here , its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order . <sssss> one of those two visits they did it incorrectly , and i had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake . <sssss> another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar . <sssss> it ran like it was vinagerette . <sssss> i 've mentioned the services issues to their manager . <sssss> first time they only apologized , never gave me reason to come back . <sssss> after three tries with this location , i 'll stick with metro center .
MID		my friend and i ended up here by accident but i 'm glad we stopped by ! <sssss> service is very attentive here , and we were quickly seated . <sssss> we ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers . <sssss> i 'd pass on the cheese puffs , they had a bizarre flavor , that i still ca n't put my finger on . <sssss> the pot stickers were perfect . <sssss> i ordered the pepper beef and it was very good . <sssss> the red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce . <sssss> it came with white rice , which i 'm not use to , since i usually have brown , but that was fine also . <sssss> decor is fine , a little 60 's china-ish but it seems to suit the place . <sssss> from the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves , it seems they agree with me . <sssss> this place is a hit .
MID		this is one of my favorite lunch places-rivals pita jungle , especially when i want to mix up my mediterranean with french fries . <sssss> prices are great for lunch , and you can opa size for a couple bucks more to include a salad or fries and a drink . <sssss> you ca n't beat it . <sssss> to go service is fast and food is always tasty . <sssss> love the big gyro salad . <sssss> staff is very friendly .
MID		food is great , love it love it love it . <sssss> the philla steak pita , the hummus , the mediterranean chicken salad , got ta love it . <sssss> wait staff on the male side is total eye candy , however , ca n't say i 'm impressed by being called dude . <sssss> my waiter need some listening skills as he forgot my soda until i reminded him for the 2nd time . <sssss> maybe cuz it was cuz he was giving elevator eyes to customers and staff . <sssss> would give this place more but think the male wait staff needs to come down to earth a bit so we can at least have a decent conversation ... dude .
HIG		this was my second visit and i got to take two of my newbies to the place . <sssss> we were seated promptly indoors , and the staff was very friendly . <sssss> i ordered a blood orange mojito and it was excellent and quite large-just the way a cocktail should be . <sssss> i ordered the chicken which was excellent and the two sides i had were the stuffing and beans . <sssss> it was sooo good . <sssss> we felt no pressure in turning over the table as they do in some restaurants . <sssss> i tried my friends mashed potatoes and they were so good . <sssss> he cleaned his plate and raved about it and he eats like a bird so i know he like it . <sssss> ca n't wait to try a new selection and for the next groupon .
MID		great food and friendly service , atmosphere lacks an italian feel . <sssss> i went here on sunday evening . <sssss> its not a large restaurant , its clean and well lit . <sssss> first though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist . <sssss> did n't speak italian to me , so i figured would wait for the food . <sssss> our first round of drinks was a little watered down , but did n't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of italy . <sssss> when they brought the food , though it spoke wonderful italian . <sssss> we had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start . <sssss> i am no fan of mushrooms , but these were great . <sssss> buttery , not too chewy , and just right . <sssss> my ex and i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs . <sssss> portions were just right and the sauce was perfect , not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess . <sssss> food was brought out fairly quickly . <sssss> i look forward to coming again , my only impression leaving was with the interior , it felt kind of like the pei wei of italian , just lacking the red trademark pei wei lighting . <sssss> maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark babbo .
MID		i like the original here next to la grande orange , but the one on central is closer , nevertheless on this visit , there were plenty of open seating , and it was nice and cool . <sssss> i ordered a mocha , as i felt it was one of those mocha sundays after a beer saturday . <sssss> the mocha was the best i have ever had . <sssss> i also ordered for our table the mozzarella and tomatoes which was really tasty and was the perfect size appetizer . <sssss> i ordered my fave , the autostrada , which was perfect , and the bread was crispy but not over done . <sssss> we had a bit of mishap with when it came to the check , as someone had made a mistake , however another member quickly resolved the issue without question . <sssss> that is why i return again and again to this place , also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great sunday lunch experience .
MID		i always have a great time at fez . <sssss> sunday night was 50 % off of all bottles of wine and we had an excellent bottle of hob nob pinot noir . <sssss> service was friendly , atomosphere is always an interesting mix and my order the lamb kisra was good as always . <sssss> the food was out to our table really fast . <sssss> you ca n't miss with fez , i think it 's time for the pomegranite chicken again next time .
HIG		nordstrom razzle dazzle boom , your customer service sends me sailing away on a mediterranean dream seas . <sssss> i purchased an armani watch over a year ago . <sssss> i kept the receipt , i know , smart right ? <sssss> well to my dismay the movement died on it . <sssss> fast fix wanted to charge $ 65 and so i thought i would give it a shot to return it for store credit . <sssss> the mens watch service associate without hesitation offered to send it for warranty repair service since they did n't carry the model anymore . <sssss> i was tickled beyond belief . <sssss> she explained the wait time , and best of all no charge . <sssss> thanks nordstrom , you did it again .
HIG		updated and still great ... i took a break from putting up christmas decor . <sssss> i was in the mood for a torta so i decided to pop by . <sssss> since my last visit , the patio has been expanded with some sun shades . <sssss> art and the interior also have some bright updating done . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and helpful . <sssss> the guacamole is great and still a highlight for me . <sssss> i ordered the carne asada torta . <sssss> the food was out promptly and the music provides a great eclectic and urban feel . <sssss> happy hour deals are great and include some food items .
HIG		eat , drink , repeat . <sssss> this was a wonderful dinner . <sssss> we started with the tortilla espanola and my friend who went to spain recently said it was better than what he had in spain . <sssss> i ordered the salpicon de congrejo and it was very light and refreshing . <sssss> the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and down to earth . <sssss> we then ordered the pollo colonial and lomo con romesco . <sssss> the flavor was beyond belief , it was so pleasing to the palate . <sssss> my chicken had this wonderful crispiness that was yet still delicate and flavorful . <sssss> my glass of malbec was really good . <sssss> the owner also came to our table and asked how everything was and apologized for it the restaurant temperature being too cold , but we did not find it cold , so it was great to meet the owner . <sssss> to top it off i had a an almond desert that was unique . <sssss> the music and atmosphere was perfect , i ca n't wait to come here again , i know some folks have mentioned the portion sizes , but i found the key is to order a number of dishes together and share . <sssss> lastly , thanks groupon for the introduction , this place really stands out .
MID		ok , i 'll admit it , i get my once a week culver 's fix . <sssss> usually the delux double w/fries ... can you say good times . <sssss> i 've done the chicken sandwich once and was not impressed so i 'd stick with a burger which is very addictive . <sssss> ever since culver 's opened , i have not set foot in a wendys for their double . <sssss> reminds me of grilled goodness from the midwest . <sssss> friendly staff too .
LOW		upside lots of theatres , downside , the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks . <sssss> went to the new sherlock holmes film yesterday afternoon . <sssss> 20 people in line , one staffer , one staffer . <sssss> normally i would use the automated box to buy my ticket , but i had a gold pass . <sssss> do n't feel like gold using it though ! <sssss> this theatre is closest to me , but it drives me nuts when they ask if i want to join their pay for rewards program . <sssss> why would i want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish . <sssss> by the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage , validate at the theatre . <sssss> they validate longer . <sssss> i made the mistake of using validation once from my big fat greek and saved a whole dollar . <sssss> i repeat one whole dollar .
LOW		while i found the majority of things that i needed i had a run in with one of the female employees here . <sssss> i wish i remembered her name but her name tag should say attitude . <sssss> i was ready to check out and found an item that i think costco had a coupon for and i remembered that i did n't think i needed it since they automatically rang up . <sssss> i asked the associate if the register would ring it up automatically and she asked me in a snotty way , `` do you need to bring your coupons to other stores to get the discount off ? <sssss> i said yes and then she said well you have your answer . <sssss> i should have asked for a manager-she needs to be coached-badly . <sssss> i do n't usually go to this one anyways , the one off of i-17 and the 101 has much friendlier staff . <sssss> otherwise , this was an ok visit .
LOW		i think dillons had a grand opening or something . <sssss> i went yesterday early evening and it was unorganized amongst the staff . <sssss> the entryway was clogged with people and it was a cluster ... well ya know . <sssss> the building itself is in bad need of an interior makeover as the tables and booths look like they are at least 20 years old . <sssss> the appetizer was some beef bruschetta thing where the meat was cold on it . <sssss> i was not impressed . <sssss> however the entry was a chicken fried chicken and it was the down home comfort food i was craving and it was hot . <sssss> i felt sorry for the staff yesterday it looked like they were trying but were in need of a good manager . <sssss> maybe i 'll try the bbq sometime but will wait a bit to see if they get the kinks out of their service .
MID		best flavorful food out of all mexican fast casual restaurant chains . <sssss> my favorite two items are the tacos and the salad . <sssss> the tacos with grilled chicken rock ! <sssss> i added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful . <sssss> the taco salads are great also . <sssss> lots of flavor . <sssss> unlike other previous reviewers i do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant . <sssss> read the website , take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed . <sssss> staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but i do n't consider this full service . <sssss> they have daily specials unlike chipotle or qdoba and outdoor seating options . <sssss> check out the drink options , amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade . <sssss> delicious
HIG		ice cream and yogurt -- step aside and exit please . <sssss> this place is tops in my book . <sssss> their are tons of flavors to choose from , you can also take in some samples and they have a flavor of the month . <sssss> seating indoors is a little limited but when the weather is decent plenty of spots outside to people watch and check out eye candy . <sssss> this is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at , and get one much more flavorful and worth the price . <sssss> my favorite flavors to date are the roche and the vanilla bean , perfect contrast . <sssss> staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy . <sssss> i 've also gelato from other spots and it is no match , this is the most creamiest , flavorful gelato i 've had to date .
MID		i love this place , it evolves in simple elegant ways . <sssss> it 's been a little more than a year since i 've last been there . <sssss> i booked the reservation on line and was able to get a reservation 45 minutes earlier than quoted by phone . <sssss> on-line is where its at . <sssss> new addition since i 've been there a cosmo dj spinning some old school tunes . <sssss> love it , love it . <sssss> took the parents , they are a little afraid of change but they give this a passing grade the last time we were here . <sssss> the sangria is very tasty and got two pitchers . <sssss> order the lamb meatballs ; pass on them , they need more flavor . <sssss> the stuffed dates are a sure hit though . <sssss> entrees were pork tenderloin and chicken . <sssss> these were all perfect and flavorful . <sssss> wait staff is perfect . <sssss> i finished off with the hazelnut pudding . <sssss> the pudding was great , the pastry that was on the side , had mystery flavors that i would pass on . <sssss> i wish there was a location arond the biltmore area . <sssss> fox restaurants this place is a hit !
LOW		i had a gift card from christmas that was burning a hole in my wallet , so i went here for a work lunch . <sssss> food was excellent , i got the four cheese pastachettis with chicken . <sssss> it took longer than expected to receive the entree but the flavor was wonderful . <sssss> cheese , cheese and more cheese just the way this midwestern boy likes it please . <sssss> service was attentive and friendly . <sssss> my only concern now is that with my digestive system is sounding like an earthquake . <sssss> i hope that it agrees with me later on this afternoon and does n't send me into a multiple dating spree with the bathroom . <sssss> yikes .
MID		we had one of the bottles of malbec , the staff was friendly , the atmosphere was open , the music was very hip lounge . <sssss> parking is a bit sparse , but i was lucky enough to nab an off street spot . <sssss> i will stop by next time for something from the menu . <sssss> the malbec was wonderful .
LOW		i had placed an order for a television last weekend over dot.com with the option to pick up . <sssss> i placed it using my debit card and jumped through the hoops of getting the authorization approved due to the amount . <sssss> i placed the order on a sunday evening at 11pm and then went into the store on monday at 12 pm the next day . <sssss> i 've always in the past been able to pick up items rather quickly with the dot.com w/pick up in store option . <sssss> mind you , i was moving so i did not get a chance to check for the pick up email , but figured after a half day , the order for the television would be ready , but not so . <sssss> i went to customer service and they stated the order was stuck in the dot.com fraud que . <sssss> i stated it was ridiculous as they had the money from the authorization and could see my id and the card i was using . <sssss> the customer service associate called the dot.com department was was told they did n't know how long it would be for the order to come through but it could be up to two days . <sssss> i asked if i would have done it in person at the store if i would have gone through the same thing and was told i probably would have walked out with the tv at the point of sale . <sssss> question best buy what is the point of ordering through your website with the store pick up if i can get it faster just by going to the store ? <sssss> so much for convenience . <sssss> i told the sales representative to tell dot.com that that was bad service . <sssss> apparently she did follow up and tell dot.com about my displeasure and they offered me $ 15 in reward zone certificates to placate me . <sssss> i would have given this two stars , but i gave it three as at least the in store associate tried to correct the issue . <sssss> for those of you that order through the website beware ! <sssss> if you use your debit card you may not be passing go to get your item until 1-2 days later .
MID		once i decided to switch this from a possible weekend burger choice to a work lunch choice , this fit it perfectly for me . <sssss> i like how they let me choose the bun that i want for my classic smash and if i ask for a side of mayo or anything it 's brought out without hesitation . <sssss> the wait is quick , the place is clean , the menu is not that complicated . <sssss> most importantly the burger has really great flavor for the money spent . <sssss> perfect for lunch when the last thing i want to do is think , at least too much . <sssss> smashburger you are a smash . <sssss> now how trite is that . <sssss> lol .
LOW		a comedy of errors is the best description for our experience last night . <sssss> our appetizer the mozzarella was over cooked and was more like potato chips , the bread was in short supply and took forever . <sssss> our entrees took over an hour to arrive on our table . <sssss> to top it off , the waitress , did n't listen on how we wanted to split our bill and one of our party had to walk to her to coach her on how we wanted the check split . <sssss> nothing hard either , split the bill , apply my $ 20 giftcard to my portion and bill me the balance . <sssss> while i do n't blame the waitress for the slow service due to short staffing , i 'm glad i do n't come often . <sssss> now i understand why . <sssss> for the money , there are plenty of other italian choices . <sssss> enough said .
MID		i always enjoy my visits to pf changs . <sssss> the quality of the food is consistently good and flavorful , and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very tasteful . <sssss> every time i come in you can see guests laughing and smiling so you know the enjoyability of the restaurant is contagious . <sssss> the staff is always very pleasant and accomodating and informative if you have any questions . <sssss> a bonus is that they issue out a 10 % off discount card that i received after a visit in downtown san jose , ca . <sssss> how can it get any better ?
MID		nordstroms is the capital of retail service . <sssss> i first visited on veteran 's day as i was looking for a stephen webster ring i found on the neimas marcus website and figured i would try nordstrom and see if they had any comparable man jewelry . <sssss> i ended up strolling past the emporio armani watches and found a lonely one that was screaming for me to take another look . <sssss> btw-it was packed this particular in this department . <sssss> i really liked the watch but extended the minimum 24 hour wait to see if you really want it rule . <sssss> the sales associate kindly gave me the style , and price information for reference . <sssss> after 48 hours i decided i really wanted it and stephen webster would have to wait . <sssss> i went in and first thing , the sales associate in the department complimented my shoes . <sssss> ok , hook was definitely sunk in . <sssss> she said that was the first thing she noticed , and then complimented the watch and it 's unique styling . <sssss> i really felt the spotlight was on me the customer as it was n't the usually schmooping you get at the target check out . <sssss> she boxed it up , asked me where i got my shoes and i was on my way , watch in tow . <sssss> normally , i look for friends and family sales for armani watches at macy 's but they did not have this style . <sssss> thanks nordstrom , for helping me with my touch of distinct and unique style .
MID		it has been quite a while since i 've been to harley 's italian bistro . <sssss> tonight we went and had one of the bread appetizers . <sssss> it was quite good and then my friend ordered the ravioli and i tried a chicken entree with pesto . <sssss> mine was quite wonderful , but the rule i find at harley 's is that not to finish your meal , have about half and take the other with you as the cuisine ends up being a bit rich on the digestive system . <sssss> our waiter was polite , in fact almost old world , old school polite , it was so sweet . <sssss> thanks pablo . <sssss> the food was great , came out relatively fast , service was attentive and it 's a relaxing environment . <sssss> when i 'm craving italian , i 'll be sure to drop by more often .
MID		this was a night of new taste experiences for me . <sssss> we arrived and the atmosphere was very light , ambient , and loungy . <sssss> no surprises since this is at the w hotel . <sssss> the restaurant staff was very friendly , and we were greeted fairly quickly . <sssss> we ordered the edamame which was a first for me , -lrb- i 'm behind the times on this one -rrb- a nice different taste . <sssss> i ordered a blackberry smash which was nothing short of wonderful . <sssss> i definitely could have ordered a double . <sssss> another person in our party had a cold sake that i found was soo good , i had to try it twice . <sssss> our waiter was very friendly , down to earth and low key . <sssss> amongst us we ordered some sushi , i ordered the ji-dori chicken and the other person in our group ordered the braised pork . <sssss> apparently they were out of pork so that was not available which was a disappointment . <sssss> food was out at a decent time and the sauce with the mushrooms and potatoes had a wonderful zing and afterbite . <sssss> our sushi eater had his eyes rolling back the entire time with his head agaisnt the booth so i can only assume the experience was nothing short of orgasmic . <sssss> we only had a small snafu with a groupon discount , but that was corrected without issue . <sssss> i 'll be sure again to come to try the pork and have multiple blackberry smashes . <sssss> even though i have not been won over to try sushi , i 'm more than willing to have this restaurant experience again .
MID		i love this place-probably the best greek food in town and its evidenced by how busy it always is . <sssss> the family knows their customers , they have my favorite items memorized and if i get an order to go for lunch at work , they are fast and very friendly . <sssss> very very tasty , and even better that its not a commericialized place , their advertising is stricly word of mouth . <sssss> this is a small business restaurant run very well .
LOW		come for the sides and appetizers . <sssss> i utilized a $ 30 groupon and tried the aspargus with goat cheese and special dressing . <sssss> the aspargus was perfectly cooked and the goat cheese was fresh and soft . <sssss> i ordered one of the more mexican/southwest style burgers and macaroni and cheese . <sssss> the macaroni and cheese was delicious and totally addicting . <sssss> the burger was ok , and seemed a bit dry even cooked at medium . <sssss> staff is very friendly , but music/background noise from televisions , etc seemed loud . <sssss> not my favorite place for burgers , but id definitely come back for the sides and appetizers .
LOW		target your pharmacy staff needs some serious help . <sssss> my healthcare provider wrote a script for a medication that was an injectable , some needles , and a syringe . <sssss> nevertheless , when i picked up the medication the syringe was on order and you could not find my order for needles . <sssss> then when i go to get my injection , i find out that the pharmacy staff was arguing with my doctors office on the size of needles needed . <sssss> who is my health care provider ? <sssss> ugh , i should have taken this particular script to cvs or someplace that does not have a 4 tech to 1 actual pharmacist ratio . <sssss> all for that $ 10 giftcard coupon . <sssss> now i 'm not sure if that free bottle of cheer was worth it for all this hassle . <sssss> i guess maybe if my clothes stay colorful and bright i can laugh about this . <sssss> remind me next time target i will only bring you prescriptions with monosyllabic words . <sssss> shish .
MID		although , i missed the taco happy hour i was able to get one of the tortas sandwiches and the chips and guacamole . <sssss> the sandwich was very good and the guacamole had a wow factor as it is not the run of the mill stuff . <sssss> the patio has been recently done/updated and being it was a nice evening outside we got to enjoy eating out . <sssss> i did not get to take in the flamenco dancing before but have done so before and found it full of fun and totally enjoyable to watch . <sssss> this place has come so far . <sssss> reminds me a bit of hotel babylon , but without the pretension
HIG		this is my favorite asian cuisine/martini happenin place in central phoenix . <sssss> staff is very helpful , relaxed and friendly . <sssss> our waitress had great knowledge of the martini and food menus . <sssss> service was fast , atmosphere is very loungy/relaxed and there are specials twice a week . <sssss> food has wonderful flavor and portions are perfect . <sssss> price is extra nice . <sssss> there is also a late night martini happy hour for like $ 5 a piece and great dj dance music . <sssss> location is perfect . <sssss> ca n't wait to go again .
MID		this was my first visit here and it felt like a neighborhood italian pizzeria . <sssss> the staff is very friendly and well the best part the pizza was wonderful . <sssss> the crust was thin and the meats on the pizza were very flavorful . <sssss> i think we had ordered the meat lovers , and it had the perfect amount of sauce . <sssss> the order came out very quickly and the waiter was very attentive and even threw in a bit of cheesy humor for measure . <sssss> parking might need some help , as it looks sparse , but i think its building specific . <sssss> i would love to come here again .
LOW		nothing to see here folks -- the food was not bad , the ingredients were fine but no flavor that leaves you with a za za zoom . <sssss> i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda . <sssss> $ 2.50 for a soda ? <sssss> the total for this lunch was $ 15 . <sssss> now i remember why i do n't come here for lunch , for the money , there are a lot better choices . <sssss> the upbeat music does not account for the $ 4 difference between this place and many others . <sssss> service was friendly , but i do n't think i 'll be back . <sssss> . <sssss> anytime soon or until i forget why i stopped in the first place .
MID		i was here for wednesday lunch using my handy groupon that i purchased recently . <sssss> the waiter was pleasant , and recognized i was busy checking voicemails and emails and did n't engage me in needless chit chat . <sssss> i ordered a couple of beers and the new york strip with a ceasar side salad . <sssss> the steak was cooked perfectly to my liking and had a tasty sauce on top of it . <sssss> the carrots were cooked just right not too mushy or crunchy . <sssss> i wish ticoz would restore some of the pricier items back to the menu as this like others are their crown jewel .
LOW		food is great , but watch out during busy times ; seating is scarce and people circle tables like vultures waiting to sit down . <sssss> favorites are turkey pastrami , butterscotch cookies and roast beef . <sssss> staff is great !
MID		we finally made it down here after hearing good things from the locals . <sssss> we only stayed about an hour but i would defiitely love to go back . <sssss> my friend and i had the $ 2 margarita special on fridays and when the server brought it out , i was like , maybe we did n't get the special -lrb- since the glass was so tall -rrb- . <sssss> but to my surprise , it was the special ! <sssss> a girl can get into alot of trouble with those yummy tall glasses of $ 2 goodness . <sssss> since we were headed to a reverse happy hour , we split their $ 10 bruschetta plate . <sssss> note , my husband orders it correctly to sound like : `` brusketta '' and the server corrects him , `` oh , the brushetta '' ? <sssss> funny but annoying , too . <sssss> the bruschetta was extremely good with three pieces each of two kinds . <sssss> when i go back , i am dying to try their white cheddar grits . <sssss> their menu looked pretty good and we loved the decor . <sssss> there was lots of different types of seating and the patio looked super cute . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and get tanked on $ 2 margaritas ... classy , i know .
MID		my husband tried this place out using an entertainment book coupon and were glad we did . <sssss> i had driven past it many times -lrb- my daughter 's pediatrician is across from it -rrb- but did n't try it since it did n't look exactly hip . <sssss> not that i go for that sort of thing but there was n't much to draw me in . <sssss> ah , the benefits of a 2-4-1 coupon ! <sssss> the inside is very warm and inviting , numerous rooms , little alcoves , and lots of seating . <sssss> it is much bigger than it looks from the outside . <sssss> free wi-fi and the baked goods are so good ! <sssss> after a visit there , this afternoon , i have been picking at one of their brownies ... ah so good . <sssss> there goes the diet but there 's always next week , right ? <sssss> we have only had their coffee and baked goods , but the sandwiches look really good . <sssss> one of these days , we 'll try them . <sssss> apparently they also have acts come and perform which is always fun at a coffee shop . <sssss> this place is on the corner of 3rd ave and mcdowell , and there is lots of windows , natural light , etc to enjoy the sights outside . <sssss> this is a charming , little spot and i am so glad i checked it out !
MID		this is more of a 4.5 start review . <sssss> boy , cherryblossom has really gotten their ish together . <sssss> the last few times i have gone have been really good . <sssss> service is alot better which has consistently been my beef with this place . <sssss> i have been impressed . <sssss> the food has always been good and the last two times i 've gone have been during lunch . <sssss> both times i have gotten the lunch bento special of the day and what a bento !!!! <sssss> for just under $ 10 , i got grilled salmon , a couple of potstickers , 4 pieces of california roll , a salad -lrb- sometimes the hot beef salad -rrb- . <sssss> i have also gotten tempura veggies with it , too , and it also comes with miso soup . <sssss> great deal !!! <sssss> on top of that , you always get ther rolls , bana bread , etc with it . <sssss> such a fan . <sssss> i ca n't wait for another day off that i can go there for lunch !
LOW		i have been dying to come here for bowling and today we headed down after lunch . <sssss> we parked in the garage under cityscape and got our ticket validated which was nice . <sssss> i noticed a sign near the entrance touting a $ 6 lunch and free game deal . <sssss> that is awesome and if i was lucky enough to work downtown , that would be such a fun thing to do on your lunch hour . <sssss> we were going to play one game which after two pairs of shoes had us at approx $ 17 . <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> luckily , my husband had this card that gave us an hour of bowling and shoes for free . <sssss> it turns out that we finished one game in 15 minutes . <sssss> i would have been pissed to pay $ 17 for 15-20 minutes . <sssss> my husband ordered a beer , me a water that tasted like flat sprite . <sssss> yuck when you are not expecting that . <sssss> the server rectified it very quickly , though . <sssss> i also ordered their pretzel snack that had 3 soft pretzel sticks with a trio of dips -lrb- cheese , mustard , and a garlic butter that intoxicated me with its smell -rrb- . <sssss> the app was $ 7 but i hear it is cheaper during happy hour -lrb- which they also have a reverse hh , by the way -rrb- . <sssss> my only beef with the app is it should be four instead of three pretzels since most people would split it with someone . <sssss> then you have the awkward `` who will take the last one , or do we split it ? '' <sssss> the game was pretty fun and i would recommend getting an hour if you are going with a group . <sssss> thirty minutes was about right for the two of us and was two games . <sssss> call me a traditionalist but i would have liked to see the `` tips '' on the monitor telling us how to achieve that unattainable split . <sssss> instead , we get how fast our ball goes down the lane which i suppose is good to know for some people . <sssss> overall , i enjoyed myself but again , the game was free . <sssss> for a brief moment , i thought it would be great to take the kids -lrb- during the day -rrb- but that would be very costly for a family of four to play 2 games . <sssss> i 'd like to come back at night and bowl then but i hear that it is extremely difficult to get a lane . <sssss> i have heard that it is still a cool place to hang out even if you ca n't get a lane so i 'll go again . <sssss> i ca n't wait to have those pretzel snacks again...day-um !
MID		this place sure is fun on a saturday night ! <sssss> no cover , stiff drinks , and kick ass music . <sssss> the main room is dance music with the next room playing hip-hop . <sssss> my girls and i danced our asses off last saturday and by midnight , this place was packed . <sssss> on thursday nights , that have a drag show but shortly after , it dies out flat . <sssss> such a shame because it would be great to continue the party there on a thursday night . <sssss> but , that 's okay , i still love getting my dance at this spot ! <sssss> you see people of all types here which is great . <sssss> everyone is there just to have a good time ...
MID		this place was alot of fun the moment we walked in . <sssss> walls lined with silly keychains , chapsticks flavors such as lucky charms , corn dog , betty crocker frosting , etc , toys for little and big kiddies , and lots of fun things for your kitchen -lrb- various designs of cupcake liners , coffee cube trays to make iced coffee , ice cube trays for fake teeth , brains , etc -rrb- . <sssss> my kind of place , for reals ! <sssss> they had old school candy , gum , etc and i had to pick up some bubble gum cigarettes . <sssss> got ta make sure i hide them from my kids ! <sssss> hubby and i took some pics in their photo booth -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- and that was fun . <sssss> they had a large variety of candy and little odds/ends toys which was fun to browse through . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go back and get some of their numbered sparklers for birthdays . <sssss> this is a great place for unique items and filling gift bags with old-school things . <sssss> they had the old school metal lunch boxes , too . <sssss> i would say this place is a little pricey but you can also find some good inexpensive buys .
MID		i wanted to give this place all 5 stars because i absolutely love hula , but i only gave it 4 because it has been inconsistent the 3 times i have been there . <sssss> my faves are the poke -lrb- incredible and i do n't even really eat that stuff -rrb- , ceviche , and the coconut shrimp rolls . <sssss> the ceviche has been inconsistent between having a ton of lime/citrus flavor to none at all . <sssss> i have had the ceviche all 3 times i have been there -lrb- and will continue to do so -rrb- so i am hoping that the dish becomes more consistent . <sssss> plus , the wontons that come with it have ranged from not being greasy , to being totally greasy . <sssss> -lrb- the totally greasy wontons were the same day as the completely bland ceviche so i was totally disappointed the last time i ordered this dish . <sssss> -rrb- as i mentioned , hopefully it gets more consistent . <sssss> the spicy seaweed salad was pretty good and so is their slaw . <sssss> things i did not like were the plantains , johnny cakes and pineapple wine . <sssss> i thought the pineapple wine would be a sweet desert wine , but weirdly , it was n't sweet but had hints of pineapple . <sssss> if you like the softer , sweeter version of plantains , this is for you . <sssss> i prefer the more thin , crisper plantains that are n't sweet . <sssss> it may seem like my experiences have been bad but they are n't . <sssss> i do n't expect to like everything on the menu but will continue to try new things and risk not liking it . <sssss> but the things that i do like keep bringing me back . <sssss> this is n't necessarily a place to bring kids , so my husband and i tend to order takeout . <sssss> when we have eaten there , however , we really enjoyed the atmosphere . <sssss> the owner is consistently there checking on various aspects and greeting the guests . <sssss> very friendly guy . <sssss> this place is a great addition to the central phoenix area .
MID		i stopped in here needing to kill some time before meeting my family for dinner at sapporo -lrb- across the parking lot -rrb- . <sssss> i always saw ads for this place in the scottsdale airpark magazine but never knew where it was . <sssss> lucky for me , i finally found it ! <sssss> there is dedicated parking in the front of the coffee shop so i parked there . <sssss> when i walked in , i was fairly stunned as it twice the size of most starbucks i have been in . <sssss> i was immediately welcomed by the employees behind the counter . <sssss> as i made my way to the counter , i kept trying to figure out where i was going to sit . <sssss> since there were a number of good spots , i decided to figure it out after i got my coffee . <sssss> the menu is expansive and includes the usual coffee drinks , pastries , sandwiches , quiche , etc. . <sssss> i settled for a small , vanilla iced coffee and a double chocolate chocolate chip cookie for just over $ 4 . <sssss> after i got my coffee , i wandered around looking for a spot . <sssss> i ended up in a back corner that housed a comfy tweed couch with knee height tables and ottoman stools . <sssss> across from it were long booths with tables and outlets under all of them . <sssss> in my corner , there was a bookshelf with used books and checkers . <sssss> as i was studying , i remember thinking how relaxed i was back there and how the music they played was good and varied . <sssss> not the typical sinatra or hip coffeehouse music they play at starbucks that annoys the living piss out of me . <sssss> although this place was so large , there was very much a comfortable feel about the place and the random corners of comfortable seating -lrb- couches , armchairs , etc -rrb- helped with that . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating too . <sssss> i really enjoyed my experience there and loved my cookie so much , i bought another one on the way out . <sssss> for the next day , of course , duh !
LOW		we came here last friday night because my husband has been raving about this place non-stop . <sssss> we waited about 15 min but there were some comfy wicker chairs out front . <sssss> once we were seated , we ordered a $ 14 bottle of cream sake . <sssss> it was extremely good and went down smooth . <sssss> we got about 8 servings out of the bottle . <sssss> having already had dinner earlier , we ordered a few apps : bacon-wrapped okra -lrb- 4 pieces for $ 5 -rrb- , panko shrimp -lrb- 3 shrimp hushpuppies for $ 8 -rrb- , and a side of 3 rice balls -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- which were crispy on the outside . <sssss> the panko shrimp came with a nice , spicy , sweet sauce with peanuts . <sssss> it was pretty good . <sssss> the bad : i had to ask for a water refill because our server disappeared , had to ask for soy sauce which i think it strange at an asian restaurant , and i felt the food was overpriced . <sssss> yes , i know tapas means small plates but i felt the portions were smaller than i have gotten at other tapas restaurants . <sssss> maybe i am spoiled from lola , who knows . <sssss> but , i gave it three stars because i did like this place but would n't go bananas for it .
LOW		my girlfriend and i were so excited to come here a few weeks ago since we have had fun in the past . <sssss> unfortunately , this time it was a bit of a letdown . <sssss> we got there at 6:30 pm and for an hour , it was $ 50 or $ 60 ... so expensive ! <sssss> not bad if there are a number of you but there was only two of us and that time , you have to purchase an hour . <sssss> okay , fine , not a big deal . <sssss> we sit down and our lane did n't work as the hour is ticking down . <sssss> you would think there is something that automatically notifies the employees that the lane has malfunctioned but i guess not . <sssss> i notified the girl and they moved us to lane 11 which is second from the last lane . <sssss> i know things happen , so that did n't really bother me . <sssss> as we are bowling though , we were so hot and sweating ! <sssss> i was practically parked by the fan on the equipment that cools your hands . <sssss> i started getting nauseous because i was so warm . <sssss> when i mentioned this to our server -lrb- because i was concerned the ac was broken on that end of the floor -rrb- , she agreed it was hot but that always happens when they raise the shades on the windows . <sssss> she said the windows get so hot that even when the sun sets , it keeps that side really warm . <sssss> i asked her to notify the manager because the heat had made us really uncomfortable . <sssss> she said she would but we never got a visit or apology from the manager . <sssss> frustrating . <sssss> if you know that is an issue then turn up the issue in that particular zone . <sssss> i do not expect to pay that much for an hour of bowling to sweat my ass off the whole time . <sssss> that is ridiculous . <sssss> on a positive note , the service was good and they had a great happy hour during the time we there . <sssss> for two apps and a beer , our bill was approx $ 10 . <sssss> i felt like that really balanced out the price of bowling during happy hour . <sssss> will i go back ? <sssss> likely . <sssss> but it is a shame that i 'll have to picky about what lane we go to which might limit our ability to even get a lane . <sssss> we 'll see ...
LOW		good lord , this place was lame on a saturday . <sssss> we went around 11:30 a.m. to eat lunch at moe 's southwest grill and which witch , and afterwards , we wanted to check out the shops . <sssss> a little after noon , only a handful of shops were open and those were pretty much only the big name shops . <sssss> even shops that had signs indicated they should be open , were n't . <sssss> i do n't know anything about retail shopping centers but it seems that westgate should regulate that . <sssss> as a result of so many shops being closed , we were bored out of our minds . <sssss> our 4 year old probably enjoyed herself the most on the splash pad . <sssss> i have been here before for a concert and it gets happening at night around the restaurants . <sssss> but retail shops , um not so much .
LOW		i have been here numerous times before and consistently liked it . <sssss> this time , i am soooo bummed out about the food . <sssss> we got here yesterday , 5 minutes after they opened and we were looking forward to hot , freshly made food . <sssss> was it hot and freshly made ? <sssss> hmmm , not so much . <sssss> the food looked good but when i took a bite , everything that should be fried was a little soggy and stale tasting . <sssss> and all of the food was lukewarm , not hot . <sssss> we ate some of their garlic blue crab and the shells were caked in garlic salt and brittle which concerns me . <sssss> the selection is varied , looks good and there is a lot to choose from . <sssss> but i do n't want to walk in a just opened restaraunt and eat food that tastes like it was microwaved from the night before . <sssss> yuck .
LOW		i have been wanting to come here forever and got a chance today due to the dine around event . <sssss> my friend and i ordered everything on the event menu : fried pork wontons with egg drop soup , egg rolls stuffed with cabbage and bbq pork , and orange chicken . <sssss> the meals came with tea , too . <sssss> due to the event , we were seated in a side room . <sssss> it was very drab and badly need of updating . <sssss> the cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary . <sssss> the waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink . <sssss> when she brought the food , we had to ask for water . <sssss> also despite knowing we were sharing , she did n't bring us any extra plates . <sssss> annoying . <sssss> one thing i forgot to add was when we first got there , we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated . <sssss> there was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event , but it did n't specify to seat yourself . <sssss> after seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us , i finally asked what we should do . <sssss> then she told us to seat ourselves . <sssss> the food was good . <sssss> i especially liked the egg rolls and orange chicken . <sssss> the orange chicken was actually delicious . <sssss> although i liked the food . <sssss> it would n't be enough to bring me back . <sssss> the atmosphere and service , from beginning to end , left much to be desired . <sssss> food simply is n't enough to bring me back to a place if service is bad .
MID		brunch here has really become my favorite on the weekends . <sssss> my go-to is the matador and one of their $ 5 cocktails . <sssss> i love it . <sssss> it is a great place to come with kids , families and friends . <sssss> everything i have tried there , i really liked . <sssss> the green bloody mary my husband had was very unique ... tasted like green tomatillo salsa but very interesting . <sssss> at the end of your meal , the donut holes with mascarpone and jelly are a must ! <sssss> i seriously hate the valet parking though ...
HIG		man , i loved this pizza . <sssss> i drive past this place on 8th st and indian school every day and have been dying to try it . <sssss> finally , on a night the hubby was not home and i had the unappealing task of cooking something , i discovered i had a 2-4-1 coupon from the entertainment book . <sssss> to me , that is the best way to try something for the first time . <sssss> if i did n't like it , hey at least i did n't pay full price . <sssss> the coupon was for b1g1 free pizza , so we got two 14 '' -lrb- one pepperoni and one cheese -rrb- . <sssss> the total came out to $ 12.37 for both pizzas ... not bad . <sssss> it was your typical ny style pizza and i was pleasantly surprised that it was n't very greasy . <sssss> this was compared to the dripping with grease pizza we had at pinos al centro . <sssss> the crust on the pizza at mamma mia 's was also delicious . <sssss> a little bit chewy and not overly thin or thick ... just right . <sssss> each pizza yield approx 9 slices and i am excited that we 've got dinner tomorow night too ! <sssss> got ta love leftover pizza . <sssss> we parked in the back parking lot which can be accessed by a little side street . <sssss> getting to the location was n't bad until you start seeing all of the rush hour traffic backing up right at the intersection of 7th st and indian school . <sssss> but at 6:20 pm on a thursday , it did n't take me long to get in and out . <sssss> the employees were extremely friendly and the guy let me exit out the back , through their small kitchen , with the pizzas . <sssss> with a 2 yr old in my arms and 10 yr old behind me carrying the pizzas , i thought that was very nice . <sssss> i am pleasantly surprised to have a new local favorite pizza joint . <sssss> i love z pizza , but mamma mia has got it down for the traditional style pizza . <sssss> i seem to recall signs in the front saying something about 2 slices of pizza and a drink for approx $ 3 which is a smokin deal . <sssss> scared to tell the husband about that one since he may start to live there . <sssss> either way , i la-la-la-love it .
MID		this has become one of my favorite local spots . <sssss> i got take-out here once a year or so ago , but wanting to use our entertainment book coupons , we came twice recently . <sssss> we dined in the last two times and really enjoyed our meals . <sssss> the service is attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is very chill and low-key . <sssss> last night -lrb- thursday -rrb- , there was a blues performer alternating between his violin and guitar . <sssss> i have been to new orleans many times and having lived in the florida panhandle , i love , love love , anything with crawfish . <sssss> boy , do they do it right with their crawfish etouffee ! <sssss> fair warning that their food can be spicy but that is typical with that food genre . <sssss> i have had their seafood gumbo -lrb- chunky , spicy goodness -rrb- , jambalaya , fried catfish , fried shrimp ... everything is very good . <sssss> i particularly love their hushpuppies with the spicy remoulade sauce . <sssss> you can tell it has a lot of horseradish in it , which i love . <sssss> they also have great mixed drinks -lrb- my favorite is the creamsicle -rrb- and they have a good selection of louisiana beers . <sssss> i honestly think this restaurant is a great representation of cajun style food and feel lucky to have it my hood !
MID		last night we came here for dinner in the mood for teppanyaki and in an effort to avoid benihana . <sssss> we came a little after 5pm on a friday and it was packed . <sssss> luckily we made a reservation which you can do on their website . <sssss> very convenient . <sssss> once we were seated , the server went over the menu with us and explained it very well which was helpful . <sssss> the happy hour menu -lrb- until 7 -rrb- could be used all over the restaurant and included rolls , some apps , and even better meals from the teppenyaki menu . <sssss> for the reduction in price , the portion of the meats were reduced . <sssss> i ordered the shrimp with calamari steak off the happy hour menu -lrb- $ 16 -rrb- and i did not feel like i missed out by not ordering it off the regular menu -lrb- $ 24 -rrb- . <sssss> i had plenty of food when factoring in the salad , fried and veggies . <sssss> the teppan meals also come with miso soup but i was n't feelin it . <sssss> for drinks , my husband and i split a large sapporo -lrb- $ 4.75 -rrb- and we ordered a crispy calamari app that was pretty good . <sssss> the chef did the usual tricks which the kids at the table loved and i liked how he played to them . <sssss> it was fun and i actually saw some tricks i have never seen before . <sssss> i forgot to add that the meals came with a mango sorbet at the end that was very yummy . <sssss> the bill came out to $ 85 which included 2 drinks , 2 kids meals -lrb- that included their drinks -rrb- , an appetizer , a teppan meal from the happy hour menu , and a teppan meal from the regular menu . <sssss> for the amount of food we got , i thought it was good . <sssss> i also really enjoyed the music they played -lrb- usher , pitbull , etc -rrb- . <sssss> i had a great time on this friday night .
HIG		i rarely give 5 stars but lord , this place was good and brought me back to my latina roots . <sssss> we stayed at the squaw peak resort and used a coupon from the entertainment book . <sssss> despite this , we managed to shell out $ 70 including tip but that was because we wanted to try everything . <sssss> we had the shrimp ceviche salad -lrb- delicious -rrb- , combo appetizer platter that had some fried pork that tasted just like pernil -lrb- puerto-rican marinated pork roast -rrb- , fried yucca , fried plantain strips -lrb- my absolute favorite -rrb- and a number of other goodies . <sssss> they have kids meals so we ordered a pupusa plate filld with chicken and a side of rice and beans . <sssss> their rice is delicious , i had to order a side . <sssss> hubby ordered a combo that he thoroughly enjoyed and son ordered a carne asada plate . <sssss> everything was delicious and the server was just so friendly and quick to tell us all about the food . <sssss> she was awesome . <sssss> the restaurant is very non-descript and in an equally non-descript , virtually deserted shopping plaza at central and dunlap . <sssss> it is just past bombero 's so you can come here for dinner and then drinks at bombero 's . <sssss> i ca n't wait to come back to this restaurant !
MID		nice , little spot we stopped in today after having lunch at pasand . <sssss> the employee was very friendly and decor was standard of a coffee shop . <sssss> despite being full from indian buffet , i ca n't help but try baked goods in a new spot . <sssss> for me , this was a soft-baked snickerdoodle , that was good . <sssss> i also had a small , non-fat pumpkin latte -lrb- yes , non-fat with the cookie ! <sssss> -rrb- that was equally enjoyable . <sssss> for a total of 2 cookies , a juice box , latte , double espresso , and small italian soda , it came out to a little over $ 10 . <sssss> not too shabby .
LOW		i finally made it down here with the family and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated on a friday night . <sssss> between four of us -lrb- 2 adults and 2 children -rrb- , we split a salad and two pizzas . <sssss> the salad was the pesto dressing house salad which had mixed greens , shaved parmesan cheese , nuts , and lord if i ca n't remember the rest . <sssss> it was very good though . <sssss> it was too bland for my husband but i thoroughly enjoyed it . <sssss> the pizza was di napoli and the crudo . <sssss> the white pizza was super greasy and too heavy for me . <sssss> the crudo was good but be warned that the salami was very spicy . <sssss> i had a glass of rose which was okay . <sssss> i tried to get the cioccolotini but they were out so we split a limoncello instead . <sssss> i loved the location and that it was a historic home . <sssss> that adds such character .
MID		wow , this was one of the best dinners i have had in a long time . <sssss> i definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that i have an entree that knocks my socks off . <sssss> for me , this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce . <sssss> my husband was surprised that i ordered this , since i do n't like mushrooms , and luckily for me , the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce . <sssss> the gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy . <sssss> i felt like i was eating a delicious mac & cheese with some soft foccaccia bread . <sssss> omg . <sssss> we also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband 's . <sssss> they were just okay to me but overall , were decent . <sssss> we also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that i really liked . <sssss> we each had a glass of wine . <sssss> our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before i ordered it . <sssss> good thing i did because i did n't like it . <sssss> the server asked what kind of wine i liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which i enjoyed . <sssss> overall , before tip , our bill was $ 50 . <sssss> very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine . <sssss> this place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio . <sssss> there were two servers and on a busy fri night , service was slow . <sssss> but they were very nice and apologetic , so i gave them a break . <sssss> i noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space . <sssss> i was very impressed . <sssss> i can not wait to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing .
HIG		such a beautiful venue . <sssss> since october 2012 , i have been 3 times : once for the day of the day performance and twice for the nutcracker . <sssss> every time , i am wowed by this place . <sssss> the performances are beautiful , engaging and well done , employees are friendly , and i do n't think there is a bad seat in the house . <sssss> there is a gift shop , couple of bars , and bakery that serves coffee , as well . <sssss> i also like that there is a desk where you can check out a booster seat for small children . <sssss> very helpful .
MID		i first tried this during a recent yelp event and a couple fellow yelpers and i came back for happy hour and dinner . <sssss> i just love the feel of this place ; bright , wide open and different areas to sit . <sssss> their happy hour is daily , 3-close , $ 5 cocktails and mini pitchers . <sssss> i enjoyed my bar drinks . <sssss> i also ordered the soft pretzel with cheese dip -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- . <sssss> it was okay but i think what made it lackluster was the lukewarm dip . <sssss> disappointing . <sssss> i really enjoyed my pork chile pot pie -lrb- $ 9.50 -rrb- . <sssss> both of my friends ordered this too ! <sssss> mine had a lot of pork in it , my friend did not have hardly any , so that seemed inconsistent . <sssss> other than that , i still enjoyed everything . <sssss> it is a great addition to the area .
MID		i can see this place is going to be a new favorite . <sssss> after coming here for an event last week , a friend and i came back today for the dine around event . <sssss> i had the grilled tomato flatbread and goat cheese fondue . <sssss> both delicious . <sssss> i had to really restrain myself from getting another fondue since this was my first stop on the route . <sssss> too bad because i could eat alot of that stuff . <sssss> drinks are decent . <sssss> today i had a mimosa -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- and red and white sangria the other night . <sssss> the sangria is dangerous ! <sssss> one item on the menu i am anxious to try is their shrimp and grits with manchego -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> oooh , that might be a visit tomorrow . <sssss> especially with the coupons the manager gave us .
MID		we came to this plaza to eat at baby kay 's to find out they were no longer there . <sssss> as we tried to figure out what next , we walked by pizzeria bianco and was like , is that what i think it is ???? <sssss> we had no idea they opened another location and were thrilled there was no line . <sssss> the weather was nice so we sat outside . <sssss> my husband and i each ordered a cocktail . <sssss> mine was the mojito which was just okay . <sssss> the antipasti we ordered as an app was amazing . <sssss> then again , we had just come from the gym and were starving ! <sssss> i stand by the amazing , though , although it should have included more cheese . <sssss> it had some parmesan , copa , brocolini , eggplant , yukon gold potatoes , mushrooms , and beets . <sssss> delicious . <sssss> i ordered the white pizza with arugula . <sssss> i enjoyed but it tasted as though lemon was squeezed over it . <sssss> lemon is not a flavor i like on anything including seafood and water . <sssss> i could have done without that but still liked . <sssss> my husband had the papparadelle . <sssss> the pasta was thick -lrb- think lasagna -rrb- but tasty . <sssss> so , for a kids milk , 2 cocktails , antipasti , a pizza , and the pasta , the bill was $ 76 ! <sssss> yikes ! <sssss> not for the faint of heart ...
HIG		this restaurant continues to be my go to spot for korean bbq since my review a couple of years ago . <sssss> every time we go , the restaurant is steadily full with a wide variety of patrons . <sssss> you can choose to cook at the table or have them cook for you . <sssss> usually we opt to cook at the table but a few nights ago , we decided to have them cook it for us . <sssss> same price . <sssss> usually , we opt for the $ 30 combo that has the daegi bulgogi , dalk gui , and the kalbi . <sssss> if i said it right , it is the spicy pork , chicken , and short ribs . <sssss> that is more than plenty for the 3 of us ... leftovers are the best ! <sssss> this last time , we each ordered a spicy pork plate at $ 13 each -lrb- my favorite and i do n't really eat spicy food -rrb- . <sssss> i felt like we looked like gluttons when the food came out . <sssss> very good portions . <sssss> i also love the panckak -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- they bring out with various items to enjoy with your meal . <sssss> my 5 year old demolished the white radishes and i had to fight her over the bean sprouts . <sssss> so good . <sssss> as always the service is friendly and attentive . <sssss> i have been to other korean bbqs where if you are n't in the same culture , you are n't treated the same . <sssss> not so with cgj . <sssss> i always enjoy my meal here . <sssss> inexpensive and delicious food .
MID		my husband and i took our 9 year old here for lunch . <sssss> it was our first time and were really hoping to like it . <sssss> well , we did . <sssss> we are huge fans of lgo and are happy to have another place like it closer to central phoenix . <sssss> for an appetizer we had the frito misto -lrb- calamari and rock shrimp -rrb- . <sssss> i was n't a fan of the shrimp but really liked the calamari . <sssss> i would have like the app to be less greasy but then again , maybe i should n't have ordered a fried appetizer . <sssss> the 3 of is split two of the small $ 10 pizzas -lrb- pepperoni and smokey - sans the olive tepanade because i hate olives -rrb- . <sssss> each of the pizzas had 6 slices and truly was plenty for the 3 of us . <sssss> we felt rather gluttonous after eating all of the pizza . <sssss> the pizzas were sooooo good ! <sssss> as i mentioned , we went during lunch but managed to get there before the rush . <sssss> i feel that we had good service and we really enjoyed our meal .
MID		i stayed here a few saturdays ago with some girlfriends and we had a great time . <sssss> i will say my lungs ached a bit after 24 hours , due to the smoke , but the casino was waaaay better than other smoky casinos i have been to . <sssss> we gambled alot and went to the club . <sssss> the music at the club was good and bad -lrb- baby got back ... really ????? <sssss> -rrb- but it was still really fun . <sssss> the late night bites at the fig restaurant was affordable and good . <sssss> although i have to question my decision to buy a greasy cheeseburger and fries at 1 am . <sssss> we stayed in one of the club level rooms and that was top-notch . <sssss> the views and accommodations were gorgeous . <sssss> we did have a bug problem but maintenance was responsive . <sssss> the club level lounge was a true treat . <sssss> it offers complimentary beer , wine , champagne , and light bites from 4-7 . <sssss> the light bites were california rolls , lo mein , egg rolls , veggie tray , chips and salsa , and mini desserts . <sssss> we got drunk and left with full bellies ... score ! <sssss> veronica , one of the conceirge staff , was simply amazing . <sssss> she was friendly , attentive , and accommodating . <sssss> the next morning , light breakfast was complimentary , too , in the lounge . <sssss> it was a choice of two quiches , cereal , oatmeal , a mango parfait , and fresh fruit . <sssss> i also really enjoyed the peet 's coffee espresso machine that made espresso , mochas , etc. . <sssss> and again , the service was impeccable . <sssss> i enjoyed the pool on sunday morning -lrb- when it was quiet -rrb- but not so much on saturday afternoon . <sssss> i was lucky to snag a lounge chair at 4 pm during their pool party amidst all of the `` reserved '' chairs for people that had been gone for hours . <sssss> there should be some preference towards guests over outside visitors . <sssss> plus , i laid out for almost an hour and not once did any wait staff come by . <sssss> i noticed they definitely catered to the rowdy groups of drinkers , though . <sssss> after walking to the bar , i found my pina colada to be reasonable priced at $ 8 and tasted delicious . <sssss> overall , great place to stay with no need to leave the premises once you are there .
MID		it was n't until going into frances , the other day , that my husband and i were stopped in our tracks with an amazing smell wafting from the prime nearby . <sssss> you know it has to smell good when it is after lunch and he is trying to talk me into stopping in for a `` small bite . '' <sssss> yeah right ! <sssss> well , when we looked at their menu last night , it was n't cutting our tastes and decided to go for china chili instead . <sssss> i 've tried this place before and it was so-so but i believe in second chances . <sssss> thank goodness for second chances . <sssss> we ordered this curry rice noodle dish mixed with chicken and shrimp . <sssss> that was my favorite part and reminded of the hamun noodle dish we used to get at the now-defunct big wong 's . <sssss> the dish was $ 9 and was enough for 3 adults . <sssss> we also had the bbq beef app -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- and the egg rolls -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- . <sssss> i was n't too much a fan of the egg rolls but everything else was great in my book . <sssss> total with a couple bucks tip was $ 20 . <sssss> i wonder how soon i can talk the husband into going back . <sssss> maybe right after our next lunch for a mid-afternoon snack ...
HIG		we attended this month 's third friday n + u event -lrb- free -rrb- at the heard and it was a blast ! <sssss> this month , it was capoeira and african drumming/dancing with an open bar and margaritas/street tacos in the cafe . <sssss> the event was entertaining , full of energy and my 3 year old and i danced for almost an hour . <sssss> my margaritas certainly did n't hurt ! <sssss> i had a great time and i am really looking forward to september 's event , jewelry and drinks !
MID		i am officially a junkie dammit , and i do n't like it one bit . <sssss> i have been twice in the past two days and am feeling terribly shameful about it . <sssss> although not too shameful to avoid the second trip ! <sssss> it used to be that i was thankful that the nearest coldstone was approx 10 min away and enough to deter me from the inevitable bingeing . <sssss> i have driven past mary coyle on numerous occasions as it is across the street from hana and that wonderful drive-thru sbux on the corner . <sssss> my husband finally brought home a wonderful little sundae surprise : a sundae with vanilla ice cream mixed with white chocolate chips , topped with whipped cream , lots of cocount shavings , a ridiculous amount of almonds all on top of a brownie . <sssss> i have never seen that many almonds on a sundae in my life . <sssss> it was a wonderful little -lrb- or should i say large -rrb- treat . <sssss> that was a month or so ago , and the last two days i have opted for mint chocolate chip ice cream , topped with whipped cream and hot fudge over a brownie -lrb- an ode to my favorite mint mint chocolate chocolate chip at coldstone -rrb- . <sssss> the prices for those sundaes are at least $ 8 and enough for two to eat . <sssss> pretty pricy as not alot of people are going to share . <sssss> and anyone comes near me and my mary coyles sundae is gon na get whopped in the head with my plastic spoon . <sssss> this place is definitely old school and has a drive-thru that kind of works . <sssss> but that is part of the charm , right ? <sssss> i am hoping that this is my last trip to mary coyle 's this week and now it 's time to take my ass to the gym .
HIG		i ca n't believe i am giving this place 5 stars but after two visits in one week , it is well worth it . <sssss> after buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts , we finally tried spinato 's -lrb- after living in phoenix since 2003 -rrb- . <sssss> yes , i fully realize how ridiculous it is that i had n't been here sooner . <sssss> there are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service , food , deals -lrb- coupon and daily deals -rrb- , and conveniences -lrb- order ahead while waiting for a table -rrb- . <sssss> from the time we sat down -lrb- both visits -rrb- , the service was top-notch and friendly . <sssss> first visit , we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes -lrb- $ 15 for a medium -rrb- . <sssss> it was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball . <sssss> that was so good too ! <sssss> oh did i forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter . <sssss> both , simply amazing . <sssss> clearly i was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline . <sssss> i also had a glass of wine since they are half off on sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go . <sssss> for the second visit -lrb- a week later -rrb- , we dialed it back a bit . <sssss> of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread , kids ravioli -lrb- $ 5 for the ravioli , a breadstick , drink , and scoop of gelato -rrb- , small specialty pizza -lrb- $ 10 and plenty for my husband and son to share -rrb- and i had the `` lil '' spinach calzone -lrb- 7 '' for $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> that calzone was so delicious , i could n't save the half i set aside for lunch . <sssss> add two glasses of wine -lrb- half off -rrb- , and two piccola brownie desserts , and our total bill was $ 45 . <sssss> for a family of four with drinks , an appetizer and 2 desserts ???? <sssss> pretty damn reasonable in this day in age . <sssss> and it has been a long time since i was that blissfully satisfied with a meal -lrb- or two -rrb- . <sssss> well done spinato 's , well done .
LOW		wow , what a great space ! <sssss> i could absolutely see myself sitting here in a chair by the open window on a warm day . <sssss> loved the decor . <sssss> my husband and i came by after lunch at thai hut . <sssss> he talked me into a small honey vanilla latte . <sssss> to be honest , i was n't into the coffee . <sssss> the roast just is n't my style but i do think alot of people would like it . <sssss> my husband bought me one of their butter cookies that are intentionally very soft in the middle , almost like you are eating raw dough . <sssss> it was good . <sssss> not awesome , but definitely a butter cookie that i have never had like that before . <sssss> the middle tasted like cheesecake to me , for some reason , but i liked it . <sssss> i definitely prefer my cookies a little more cooked but i would say i enjoyed this cookie . <sssss> even though my experience was just okay , i look forward to returning . <sssss> the employees were friendly and i loved the atmosphere .
HIG		one of the managers at my job decided to treat us to flo 's for lunch yesterday . <sssss> i practically did cartwheels in my aisle because a -rrb- i was determined to eat out on my friday and b -rrb- i love flo 's . <sssss> i ca n't recall if anything i have eaten there was subpar . <sssss> i ordered the pepper bacon shrimp which is mixed with tomatos , cabbage , and bacon . <sssss> with this you can choose between white or brown rice , and it comes with their house salad . <sssss> the dressing is spicy and unique . <sssss> they also bring out wontons with a sweet and sour sauce . <sssss> between those and my affinity for chips and salsa , i will never have a six pack . <sssss> anyhoo , service there is speedy without you feeling rushed . <sssss> that place runs like a well-oiled machine . <sssss> it is nice when you go during your lunch hour because you are in and out within the hour , usually . <sssss> my husband says their mongolian beef is the best he has ever had and since he comes from the seattle with plenty of asian food , i believe him . <sssss> there lunches are on average $ 7-9 . <sssss> not bad considering the amount of food you get . <sssss> i can usually make a second meal with my leftovers . <sssss> i wish they would bring a flo 's down to central phoenix so i could have it more often .
HIG		i really love sidebar and its random location -lrb- above starbucks and pei-wei with the entrance on the side of the building -rrb- . <sssss> this is such a cute local spot with great techno/electro music and decor . <sssss> i love the random cult classic/b-movies that show , too . <sssss> the drinks are decent and if i recall , reasonably priced . <sssss> they have appetizers , too , but i have n't tried them . <sssss> i have been there a few times including new year 's for the upcoming 2009 . <sssss> everytime , i have really enjoyed myself . <sssss> there is a diverse group of people and i have never felt that people were snooty or pretentious . <sssss> for me , those are huge turn-offs at any place . <sssss> i ca n't say i would make the drive here if i did n't already live so close , but for a local spot , it is sa-weet .
MID		wow , what a great addition to the biltmore area ! <sssss> i love the layout with with all of the various shops tucked off to the side . <sssss> i went last sunday and it was n't too crazy . <sssss> there is a coffee shop , bakery/restaurant , a couple of clothing boutiques -lrb- including frances -rrb- , smeeks -lrb- closed its central ave location -rrb- , and a couple of home decor boutiques -lrb- including paris envy which closed it 's 7th ave location -rrb- . <sssss> there was also a really cool bicycle shop that had the funnest -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- helmets . <sssss> kind of pricy though at $ 60 but i still want one ! <sssss> the shop also had lots of bicycle accessories that made me consider the lack of baskets on my beach cruiser . <sssss> the thing i loved most about union is the ability to pop into the various local shops without having to drive a bunch of places . <sssss> it 's cozy and lots of trinkets to be found . <sssss> including a $ 3 toy i bought for my daughter that she lost soon after ! <sssss> : -rrb-
MID		i live within walking distance from the clarendon and ca n't believe i have n't been here yet . <sssss> yesterday , my husband lured me into skipping yoga to go get some mexican food here . <sssss> we took the family here for taco tuesday and during happy hour . <sssss> we ordered the $ 5 chirraron de queso -lrb- cheese cooked into a hard shell -rrb- -lrb- decent -rrb- , $ 5 guacamole -lrb- holy hell this was good -rrb- , $ 5 white sangria -lrb- decent -rrb- , chips and salsa -lrb- $ 3.5 -rrb- , a kids bean and cheese burrito -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- that was the side of my 3 year old 's head , and 8 mix-n-match tacos -lrb- pork , carne asada , shrimp , fish , veggie -rrb- . <sssss> for taco tuesday , they are buy 2 get 1 free , which is the deal we were given , but we would have saved more with the $ 1 off per taco during hh . <sssss> i ordered a shrimp taco and pork taco . <sssss> both were delicious but the pork taco really tickled my fancy . <sssss> the pork had that crispy bark on the outside which is my absolute favorite . <sssss> call it the puerto-rican in me but that is the best . <sssss> i really enjoyed my meal and the server was great . <sssss> i know i loved this place when i am trying to talk my husband into going back in a couple of days ...
HIG		easily , one of the best red velvet cakes i have had . <sssss> a few weeks ago , a co-worker picked up one of the cakes for a birthday . <sssss> the cake was moist and i was thrilled to encounter chocolate chips in the cake ! <sssss> wow . <sssss> i knew from a yelp event last year that they had small individual sizes so after having that red velvet cake , i made a beeline back to this shop . <sssss> i was crushed when i entered the store and did n't see any in the display , but no fear , they had some in the back . <sssss> as i looked around the shop , i noticed cute items for the kitchen -lrb- dish gloves , etc -rrb- . <sssss> regardless , my red velvet cake was deelicious !
HIG		after months of suggesting thai hut for take-out , i am finally fulfilled ! <sssss> i have been wanting to come back and eat but being the good wife , we have gone to other thai places to satisy my husband . <sssss> by this point , i finally put my foot down and said `` do not try to talk me out of thai hut !!! '' <sssss> -lrb- true story , ask my husband . <sssss> -rrb- i pretty much only get one thing here , the garlic pepper chicken -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- . <sssss> considering i hate pepper in my food , this dish is delicious to me -lrb- hence why i am loyal to it -rrb- . <sssss> it is chopped chicken mixed with cabbage , broccoli , carrots with a nice garlicky broth . <sssss> they give a pile of white rice with it , too , which is just perfect . <sssss> if i put my mind to it , i can easily polish off most of this dish . <sssss> well , maybe the lunch size which is still a good portion . <sssss> with the lunch , i can make a second meal . <sssss> with a dinner , i had plenty for dinner and was able to split the rest into two lunches . <sssss> sweet ! <sssss> garlic pepper chicken two more meals ????? <sssss> it does n't get any better than that . <sssss> if you have a chance to eat-in , try and score a window table facing mcdowell ... great people watching and views of the city streets . <sssss> i just love it !
HIG		so far , i have been to lola twice -lrb- a saturday night and monday morning -rrb- . <sssss> saturday night was very quiet compared to the super busy monday morning . <sssss> free wi-fi , coffee , baked goods , and awesome location ... you ca n't beat it . <sssss> the morning we went , we had a monterrey jack scone that was really good . <sssss> i laughed when i got my latte in a `` so i married an axe murder '' - esque cup . <sssss> we sat along the high tables facing central ave and i really enjoyed surfing the internet and looking out towards central . <sssss> there are various types of seating as well as some outdoor tables . <sssss> i really loved this place but worry that it will be one of those places that will be so popular , you 'll never get to sit there . <sssss> that is why i stopped going to lux because it eventually got so crowded all of the time . <sssss> my favorite part of lola coffee is being right on central and watching traffic and the light rail go past . <sssss> love it , love it .
MID		i dug my latest experience here friday night . <sssss> i had n't been by in a few years but lola coffee had locked their doors at 8:30 pm -lrb- wtf ??? <sssss> -rrb- , so lucky for me , lux is right down the street . <sssss> it was n't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out . <sssss> i had a small , non-fat sugar free vanilla latte -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- and picked up a homemade , oatmeal creme sandwich for $ 3 . <sssss> pluses : i love the msmatched , kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable . <sssss> free wifi , and a wide variety of baked goods . <sssss> i can always be sold on baked goods . <sssss> this might be a weird plus , but i was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside . <sssss> i am probably the only person that never had this before , but who cares , i loved it . <sssss> totally refreshing on a hot az night . <sssss> neutral : the employees were n't exactly friendly but were n't rude , either ... just kind of indifferent . <sssss> hmmm , correct that , they were very friendly with the regulars but i sort-of felt unwelcome at first but i quickly got over that . <sssss> negatives : the music is too loud . <sssss> maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but i was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what i was studying . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , i loved the music but it was a bit much . <sssss> okay , alot much . <sssss> bottom line , this is still a great little local coffee shop and i might be stopping here instead of lola next time ...
MID		so , i feel like i should n't have liked this place as much as i did but this place was fun as hell ! <sssss> i was sober , too , so that gives me a shred of credibility ! <sssss> this was our last stop on our date night and we were going to do the walk-by thing and see what was up . <sssss> as we approached -lrb- 11:30 pm on a sat night -rrb- , i could hear the dance music pumping , see alot of people in the front which were encouraging signs . <sssss> there was no cover and it was n't overly crowded . <sssss> i felt like the mix of people were the standard downtown crowd which was a mix of everything ! <sssss> i had to love the people dressed in 80 's clothes and the guy with the mullet wig . <sssss> we had a vodka tonic and two shots which came out to $ 19 ... not bad . <sssss> i really loved the music and attempted to dance off the padre 's we had for dinner . <sssss> this place is literally an extension of the san carlos hotel lobby so the room with the dj and dance floor was all carpeted , remniscent of banquet rooms . <sssss> but other than the carpeted dance floor , it was a really fun place . <sssss> the entrance towards the bar was marble floors with a chandelier overhead -lrb- hotel decor -rrb- and there were a few touches to fit with the haunted theme -lrb- since hotel san carlos is haunted -rrb- . <sssss> do n't come here expecting it to be a fancy bar/club . <sssss> some things were a little cliche and cheesy but i thought that made it fun .
MID		although a number of halloween stores begin cropping up over the holiday , i think it is always good to try and support the local businesses . <sssss> i had an idea of what i was going to dress up for halloween but in typical fashion , i changed my mind a few days before the halloween party . <sssss> easley 's has practically anything you might need even though how dare they not have my rocky horror picture show costume . <sssss> the absolute nerve ! <sssss> i quickly found some good substitutes and the shop was running very efficiently . <sssss> there were many employees around although i encountered major attitude/rudeness by one of the temporary employees manning the fitting rooms . <sssss> other than that bs , i found the employees to be very helpful and willing to help . <sssss> you can get all types of costume make-up here , accessories galore -lrb- i got a rhinestone feather duster for my magenta costume ... cool -rrb- , and of course , the wide range of costumes are amazing . <sssss> you can be a giant banana , lady gaga , gorilla costume with a toga -lrb- party animal -rrb- , and typical superheroes/occupation costumes . <sssss> i got ta say , too , that easley 's is extremely reasonably priced . <sssss> my costume was $ 25 , wig $ 15 and feather duster $ 5 . <sssss> that 's not bad considering i got a wig and additional accessories with the costume . <sssss> beware , though , there is no refund/return policy in case you change your mind . <sssss> and hey , after you work up an appetite , head to zoe 's right next door !
MID		i came here yesterday for a spagirls event . <sssss> the normal $ 35 blowdry was $ 25 . <sssss> located in the scottsdale quarter , i parked in the south garage which was just off the side street drybar was located . <sssss> it did n't take me long to locate it and it was a very short walk from the garage . <sssss> the decor was light and nicely done . <sssss> on saturdays and sundays , they have champagne and dessert until 2pm so i had a couple of mimosas during my time there . <sssss> my appt was at 2pm but they got me in 15 minutes early which was nice . <sssss> when they took me back , christine washed my hair and talked to me about the conditioning shot for my hair . <sssss> for $ 20 , it is supposed to last for 6 weeks . <sssss> i thought , why not , since summer is coming and my coarse hair is about to get drier . <sssss> i asked christine to do what i think is called `` straight up '' which is stick straight . <sssss> since my hair is really thick , it took her awhile but she did a fantastic job ! <sssss> i have honestly never seen my hair look this good . <sssss> my girlfriend went too and i never saw her curly hair look that good straight . <sssss> she had her ends curled whereas i did mine all straight but both of our hair looked awesome . <sssss> when i got home and went to work , i received many compliments . <sssss> i felt the staff was very friendly and i would definitely go back . <sssss> they have packages like 3 blowdrys for $ 100 which saves some $ . <sssss> i would n't go to drybar all of the time but for a girl with curly hair , it is a nice indulgence to have someone blowdry and style it straight for me . <sssss> love it !!
HIG		i finally joined this gym after weeks of agonizing over the monthly rates . <sssss> i was having a hard time justifying the approx $ 80/mos fee . <sssss> turns out , i did n't have to stress that hard since i got a decent rate already being a gold 's gym member in the north scottsdale gym . <sssss> because i was already a member , my new rate was $ 50/mos and even though my husband was not a member , he got that rate , too . <sssss> that might seem like alot but the hot yoga classes were a major factor for me . <sssss> even though they only offer one hot yoga class per week , they will be increasing the frequency due to the popularity . <sssss> so , in my opinion , i am getting unlimited hot yoga per month for an added $ 25 to my existing gym membership . <sssss> way , way worth it to me when i factor in bikram yoga 's rates . <sssss> there are a number of features to this gym that other reviews have already mentioned . <sssss> they have individual spinning bikes that have individual screens allowing you to use a digital spin instructor . <sssss> this is great if you ca n't make it to their live spin classes . <sssss> all of the cardio machines have tvs that you can plug your headphones in . <sssss> the employees actively seek suggestions to add machines they do n't already have . <sssss> members are also offered a workout towel and shower towel so you do n't have to bring one . <sssss> i like the option of the validated parking -lrb- 2 hours -rrb- . <sssss> if i want to go to an event downtown , i can fit in a short workout , shower , and then leave my car in the garage for whatever time i have left in the garage . <sssss> i 'm not sure how busy the gym will get after awhile , but for now , i am enjoying the easy and quick access to any of the machines . <sssss> lots of people-watching and nice views are to be had working out by the windows ... you ca n't beat it .
MID		my girlfriends and i came last week to watch bridesmaids on a thursday night . <sssss> we bought the tickets online to reserve our seats . <sssss> the $ 17 seats -lrb- personal wait staff , free popcorn , pillow and blanket -rrb- were sold out , so we got the $ 14 seats . <sssss> this place is located on the second floor by narcisse and next to tanzy -lrb- shares a lobby by the concession stand -rrb- . <sssss> that place was packed ! <sssss> the decor is posh and upscale , club-like , with plush seating throughout . <sssss> we got in line to get some food and were in line forever !!!!! <sssss> there was only one cashier and it took so long to get through . <sssss> annoying when trying to make the start of the movie . <sssss> anyway , they had a variery of hot food you could order , beer/wine , typical movie snacks , and a display case with additional snack foods -lrb- cheese/fruit , hummus and chips , tiramisu , salad , etc -rrb- . <sssss> my chips and hummus were $ 9 but i expected it to be a little pricy . <sssss> to be honest , i was n't digging the chips at all and would have preferred pita bread or pita chips . <sssss> the leather seats were very comfortable and i liked the tray table that could be moved however you like . <sssss> we really enjoyed ourselves and i think the experience was worth the cost of the ticket . <sssss> they need to become a little more streamlined in the handling of their concession stand , though .
MID		i really love this hotel and i have never even stayed in the rooms . <sssss> not only is their restaurant , gallo blanco , one of my favorites in phoenix , but every wednesday , they have flamenco music/dancers from 7-9 . <sssss> those nights get packed and are alot of fun/high energy . <sssss> i have taken friends and family on wednesday and they enjoyed the performance as much as i do . <sssss> last weekend , we used their pool . <sssss> we live within walking distance , and have a pool too , but hey , nothing beats having drinks served to you ! <sssss> . <sssss> we got there around 2 and it was packed ! <sssss> no matter as they had fake grass laid out around the pool and we set up camp on one in a shaded spot . <sssss> all around the pool are these fragrant blossoms , trees , variety of lounge chairs , couches , beds , and chill music playing . <sssss> so relaxing . <sssss> the server came around frequently and another employee came out handing out free otter pops and bottled water . <sssss> so awesome ! <sssss> you could also order food from the restaurant . <sssss> my husband , daughter , and i had an awesome time . <sssss> there was a good mix of families , singles , gays , friends , etc. . <sssss> we felt very comfortable there and see lots of fun to be had in the summer ! <sssss> one note , be careful around the cool looking blue glass in the cement around the pool . <sssss> some of it had broken off and gotten in my foot . <sssss> not very cool when people are walking around barefoot and with kids around .
MID		after last night at cmye phoenix city grille , the husband and i were n't in any condition to cook dinner tonight . <sssss> we started flipping through the entertainment book to see where we might go for dinner . <sssss> it has been a long time since we have been and paella sounded damn good for my hangover . <sssss> we got there around 6pm and was maybe the fourth table there . <sssss> i ordered a pina colada and the husband had wine . <sssss> i really liked the pina colada and the fried calamari that was very tender . <sssss> no one likes overly chewy calamari . <sssss> for dinner , i had the paella valenciana -lrb- the typical paella dish , $ 28 -rrb- and my husband had the paella negra -lrb- black rice with lobster , calamari , shrimp , chicken , etc , $ 32 -rrb- . <sssss> both dishes were delicious and each were more than enough to split between two people . <sssss> the next time we go , we would probably split one paella . <sssss> we were using a bogo deal , so it made sense to get the two and have dinner for another night . <sssss> as we were wrapping up dinner , the band began playing and shortly thereafter , the flamenco dancer came on . <sssss> the music and flamenco performance was so great and really added to the experience . <sssss> by this time , the restaurant was packed and our 3 year old was having a blast trying to dance like the flamenco dancer . <sssss> after they played their set -lrb- 30 minutes -rrb- , the singers and dancer walked around to talk with the patrons . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> overall , the drinks were good , food was good , service was good , and so were the musicians . <sssss> really great time and looking forward to the next !
HIG		i was so blown away by my recent meal here and could safely say it was the best korean bbq i 've had . <sssss> we came using a buy with me certificate and ordered a combo that had three kinds of meats -lrb- spicy pork , beef , and chicken -rrb- for $ 30 . <sssss> that and an order of gyoza easily fed three of us and could have fed four people . <sssss> the atmosphere was very comfortable with friendly service . <sssss> i kept groaning in pleasure every time i ate the spicy pork . <sssss> i even resorted to pulling burnt bits off the grill plan with my chopsticks , it was so good . <sssss> at the end , we tried the coconut boba frappe which was delicious . <sssss> i never had boba before and the coconut one was just right . <sssss> do yourself a favor and try this little spot !
MID		i do n't why i wanted to come so bad , because i 'm not generally into chicken fried steak , but sometimes you get a craving , ya know ? <sssss> finally , we had a chance and took the family . <sssss> this place is at the corner of 16th st and bethany home and the parking lot can be slightly awkward . <sssss> i think we went on a thurs night and they had dinner chicken and dumplings -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- for one of the daily specials . <sssss> i really wanted chicken fried steak -lrb- $ 12.50 -rrb- but what in the hell was i going to do with all the steak i heard they give you ? <sssss> um , no . <sssss> i did manage to convince my husband to share some of his even though he insisted he was going to eat the entire thing . <sssss> mind you , this was before we saw the portions ! <sssss> so , the hubby ordered the chick fried steak , me the chick-n-dumplings , son ordered tke kids cheeseburger -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- and 3 year old shared our food . <sssss> we also had the fried okra app that was so good . <sssss> breaded just right , tender and with a horseradish-type sauce . <sssss> yum . <sssss> when the food came out , i was laughing so hard at how large the chicken fried steak was . <sssss> needless to say , my husband was not eating that whole thing . <sssss> he was n't a huge fan of it , but i was . <sssss> i thought it was flavored well and i really liked the batter -lrb- think a light beer batter -rrb- . <sssss> my chicken and dumplings were awesome . <sssss> the chicken was plentiful and tender , within the white gravy , and biscuits soft . <sssss> it came with a side of buttered corn , too , which were good . <sssss> oh yeah , my meal came with a choice of salad or slaw . <sssss> i chose the slaw which was creamy , just the way i like it . <sssss> the kids burger was good , and it was neat because it also comes with an individually packaged , small blue bell ice cream scoop . <sssss> th kids loved that . <sssss> the service was great , too . <sssss> the server was friendly in addition to the other staff . <sssss> would i come back for the chicken fried steak ? <sssss> maybe not , but i definitely would for the chicken and dumplings . <sssss> maybe after i sweat enough calories at bikram yoga !
MID		i have only been to fez 3-4 times but i am cuh-razy for their rosemary fries and their bread plate with the pesto dip , tomato sauce , and something else i ca n't recall . <sssss> my favorite thing to drink there is the pomegranate margarita ... that one drink kicks my ass every time . <sssss> i love the atmosphere and it is always pretty happening with a diverse group of people .
LOW		sorry , mary coyle , i am officially over you . <sssss> i have been a few times since my last review and your portion sizes are too inconsistent with your prices . <sssss> i have gotten either twice the amount or half the amount of sundae for approximately the same price over the last few times . <sssss> last night was the last straw . <sssss> for a small scoop of mint choco chip ice cream over a brownie , some whipped cream , and hot fudge , i paid $ 8.47 . <sssss> i gave you two stars because the sundae tasted good but i am not willing to come back and pay those prices for something i can get a couple of dollars less down the street . <sssss> see ya ...
MID		i really like this restaurant and previously had just gone to their arcadia location . <sssss> the scottsdale location is close to work so i gave it a try with an deal i bought -lrb- which reminds me that i have one more left ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i got the same thing that i order at the other location : mediterranean omelet with egg whites -lrb- no extra charge -rrb- , spinach and feta . <sssss> i was happy to see that the preperation was consistent . <sssss> i also ordered the 1/2 brioche french toast . <sssss> god , it was delicious . <sssss> thank goodness for the healthier omelet . <sssss> service was great -lrb- i went at lunchtime during the week -rrb- and very attentive . <sssss> i would definitely go back . <sssss> my bill was just under $ 14 so i was pleased .
HIG		oh al-hana , your garlic sauce will be the end of me . <sssss> this little spot in the baiz market is not located in the best part of town but is truly a gem . <sssss> my husband loves their schwarma sandwiches and i always get the chicken ta-ook -lrb- i apologize profusely for the atrocious spelling -rrb- . <sssss> i also love the tabouli . <sssss> we have also had their meat and cheese pies which are pretty good . <sssss> they have really good hummus and babaganoush . <sssss> the garlic sauce that comes with it is to die for and i always want to eat ungodly amounts of it . <sssss> pita bread and garlic sauce ... that could be my meal in itself . <sssss> love it . <sssss> i always like picking up a packages of pita bread while we are there . <sssss> i think we spend less than $ 1 for a pack of 6 pitas . <sssss> crazy cheap ! <sssss> would i go to baiz to buy groceries ? <sssss> not so much but we definitely make the drive for al-hana .
HIG		i do n't even know why i am addicted to this place but i am . <sssss> i unequivocably love sweet tomatoes . <sssss> this buffet is great for fresh food and the ability to dine healthy if you want . <sssss> i also love that our 2 year old can eat healthy for free . <sssss> for salads , you can choose from pre-made salads or create your own . <sssss> there is also a food theme depending on the time of the month which determines the specialty salads , soups , pasta , etc. . <sssss> there are usually 4-5 types of soups , baked potato , sweet potatoes , 2 types of pasta , muffins , breads , baked desserts , fruits , and ice cream . <sssss> my favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup , their foccacia style sliced bread -lrb- so wonderfully garlicky -rrb- and their freaking lava cake . <sssss> their lava cake is always the end of me even when i try to eat reasonably . <sssss> what is also great for you sweet-tooth people , are the servers bringing around freshly baked chocolate chip cookies . <sssss> ah , sweet heaven ... or should i say , sweet tomatoes ...
MID		thank goodness this place has occupied the unfortunate corner of short-lived restaurants . <sssss> there is nothing worse than giving a place a chance , getting attached to it and then it shutting down shortly thereafter . <sssss> luckily , america 's taco shop has a loyal following and i sincerely hope it stays put in the 7th ave location . <sssss> last night was my 4th time here and it grows on me more and more . <sssss> had i wrote this review the first time i went -lrb- 7th st location -rrb- , i think i would have given it 3 stars . <sssss> i mean , to state that it has the best carne asada ? <sssss> i still would n't go that far but i always enjoy my food . <sssss> last night , i had a carne asada taco , pastor taco , and chips/salsa/guacamole . <sssss> i love pastor tacos but am not a fan of theirs . <sssss> they add pineapple to theirs which is my thing . <sssss> i love pineapple alone , not warm with food . <sssss> again , not my thing . <sssss> i have had their carne asada tostada in the past . <sssss> i was a little turned by the warm , wilted lettuce on top but i guess that is what happens when it is wrapped with foil . <sssss> but the tostada was okay . <sssss> their bean and cheese burritos are awesome . <sssss> it is so simple but the flavor is really good ... love it . <sssss> i have n't eaten there in person -lrb- we always get take-out -rrb- but from the outside , the restaurant is adorable and oh-so inviting . <sssss> my daughter 's day care is right across the street and this place is always busy . <sssss> good sign ...
MID		this place is great ! <sssss> i took the kids here after a day at the phoenix children 's museum and got some ice cream . <sssss> my son had a coke float , daughter had a scopp of ice cream and i had a hot fudge sundae . <sssss> holly hell , that hot fudge sundae was as big as my head ! <sssss> and i loved every bit of it . <sssss> you walk through an antique room to get to the restaurant and then there is a vintage/antique store connected on the other side , too . <sssss> after the ice cream , we wandered around and looked at all of the cool stuff for it . <sssss> unfortunately , my four year old is like an elephant in a china store , so i could n't exactly relax . <sssss> the next day , i came back and picked up some reasonably priced vintage/thrift store dresses around $ 20 a piece . <sssss> the black dress was perfect for a 20 's party i attended and the second dress was a long sleeved , low cut , long red dress with yellow flowers that i am wearing today for a halloween party . <sssss> ice cream and antiques are the way to spend the day !
HIG		we came here to satisy my sweet tooth and given that i am done with mary coyle . <sssss> i had only been here once before to get coffee and always meant to come back . <sssss> boy , am i glad i did ! <sssss> after dinner , the four of us took a walk down to pink spot . <sssss> i took a look at their menu online so i knew what i wanted . <sssss> i ordered the one scoop black-n-white sundae but substituted mint choco chip ice cream . <sssss> it was great . <sssss> the girl layered the brownie , hot fudge , and mint chocolate all the way to the top of the cup and topped it with whipped cream and nuts . <sssss> i loved the multiple layers . <sssss> we also got a chocolate covered banana for my husband -lrb- which caused endless jokes from me ... could not resist ! <sssss> -rrb- , and two kids ' ice cream scoops . <sssss> the total ? <sssss> $ 11 . <sssss> pretty shocking given i just spent a little over $ 8 for one regular ice cream sundae the other night at mary coyle . <sssss> everything was really good and the best part was we could burn calories walking to and from pink spot . <sssss> on the way out of this place , my husband noticed that they do bagel boxes -lrb- dozen bagels -rrb- for about $ 13 so i 'll definitely need to come here when i want to bring bagels for the office . <sssss> i would much rather support the local business than go to einstein 's for bagel buckets .
HIG		i freakin love the hell out of this place . <sssss> with my previously passed dog , i used to take him for the self-wash which ranges from $ 11 , i think to $ 17 . <sssss> this depends on the shampoo , etc that you use . <sssss> there are blowers to dry your pets , too . <sssss> for my newest dog , who does n't need as frequent baths , i take her often for the nail trims . <sssss> her nails grow so fast and it is convenient to walk in and get nails clipped for $ 8 . <sssss> i think i get more excited at the prospect of buying her treats at the bakery counter . <sssss> there is a great variety of biscuits , cookies , etc , and i love that they have `` muffins '' and `` cupcakes '' for your pets . <sssss> there is also a plenty of pet food , toys , and gear . <sssss> we also picked up some spray for shedding and sour apple spray for our puppy 's chewing . <sssss> they have a rewards card that sends you 5 % when you spend $ 500 . <sssss> wag-n-wash is definitely a one stop shop for pet owners !
MID		i always see a lot of my friends checking in here so i thought it was time to check it out . <sssss> my husband loved it more than me , but i thought it was decent . <sssss> i ordered one of the omelet specials which was really good . <sssss> it came with carmelized peaches on the side which were good but the cinnamon sauce/syrup had run all under my omelet . <sssss> i tried to eat around the egg parts that had n't absorbed the sauce but it was difficult . <sssss> maybe i am weird but i like some of those foods kept really separate . <sssss> my daughter had a blueberry pancake which was really good . <sssss> it seemed like they made it in a cast iron skillet which lended to the yummy cooked edges . <sssss> my husband 's omelet was good too .
LOW		after a recent trip to seattle , my husband has been on an asian food kick which encouraged him to finally try this place . <sssss> on his 3rd or 4th time eating there , he convinced me to order take-out . <sssss> normally , it had n't taken long to get his food in the past but this time , we sat in the parking lot for over a half hour . <sssss> apparently , everyone had to wait awhile . <sssss> i ordered the chicken/shrimp fried rice that was extremely flavorless and dry . <sssss> so disappointing as i have n't had a good fried rice in awhile . <sssss> my husband ordered banh-mi , spring rolls and another app that you basically put together -lrb- pork , vermicelli noodles , lettuce -rrb- . <sssss> i loved the banh-mi which was a sandwhich on a type of hoagie roll with pork , mayo , shredded carrot , cucumber and peppers . <sssss> i was so surprised at how much i loved the sandwhich . <sssss> the sandwiches are $ 2.25 and our whole bill was approx $ 17 . <sssss> i did n't exactly enjoy my meal but i think this place is definitely worth a try . <sssss> everyone has their off nights , right ?
LOW		generic soup , salad , sandwich place with lots of options . <sssss> i picked a soup and half sandwich combo , with the turkey avocado panini and chicken tortilla soup . <sssss> the sandwich looked so unappealing and did n't taste much better than that . <sssss> the soup was decent . <sssss> i liked the chocolate covered strawberry ... was n't expecting that . <sssss> i think this is a good addition to the plaza , but i would rather go to the biltmore for paradise bakery .
HIG		i absolutely love this place and truly wished i lived closer . <sssss> i am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here . <sssss> i say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in . <sssss> but ... this review is about me not him ! <sssss> ; -rrb- for me , i love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques . <sssss> i love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as paradise bakery , chipotle , coldstone creamery , etc. . <sssss> in the summer , they have the misters going and in the winter , it is the fireplace . <sssss> there is also a harkins movie theater . <sssss> apart from the middle strip of shops , i like that i can hit up a target , ulta , bevmo in one stop . <sssss> who cares if i need to drive across the marketplace , the key thing is that i do n't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place ... so convenient . <sssss> i do n't get the parking complaints from other reviewers . <sssss> how is that the fault of the marketplace ? <sssss> there is an over-abundance of parking spots , but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity . <sssss> if you are a bargain shopper , you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops . <sssss> my husband and daughter got bogo frozen yogurt from mojo yogurt today . <sssss> there is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones . <sssss> this is a great place to cover anything you might need .
HIG		i have n't been to zoe 's for probably a year but i always love it when i come ! <sssss> as i typically do , i recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions , and your choice of a side -lrb- i chose their rice-yummy -rrb- and their greek salad . <sssss> the salad is always huge so i usually save it for its own meal later . <sssss> their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good . <sssss> we also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good , itself , but i like to put the dressing on it , too . <sssss> my husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome . <sssss> my brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it , too . <sssss> the food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy . <sssss> the prices are average for most places , nowadays and i think the grilled chicken plate at approx $ 7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it . <sssss> oh yeah , their fountain lemonade was out when i went but my husband recommended i try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter . <sssss> i am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious . <sssss> not too tart or too sweet , just perfect . <sssss> love , love , love zoes .
MID		i stopped by here today on my way to the unfortunately closed rowdy boutique . <sssss> i figure what better way to cure my shopper woes by stuffing my face with a chocolate cupcake ? <sssss> okay , we got more than that but i had good intentions to stop at one . <sssss> anyways , for me , we got the milk chocolate chip cookie , brown velvet cupcake and chocolate cupcake . <sssss> for hubby , we got the urban cookie -lrb- dark chocolate , coconut , and oatmeal -rrb- , their speciality cookie : cherry , and a carrot cupcake . <sssss> the cookies are $ 1.79 and cupcakes $ 1.99 . <sssss> all i have eaten thus far is the chocolate cupcake and oh man , it was heaven . <sssss> the cake was very moist and the frosting was lick off my fingers delicious . <sssss> it tasted like a dark chocolate frosting so a hint of that dark chocolate bitterness . <sssss> yum , yum , yum . <sssss> now , i wonder if my husband will remember that he has a carrot cupcake or miss it if i snatch it up ??? <sssss> i suppose it is a little expensive but well worth it for those once in a while indulgences or to surprise someone with a sweet treat . <sssss> and sweet treat , it was ...
LOW		my husband and i came to celebrate the end of his mba program . <sssss> he is a major steak lover and loves these kinds of places but neither of us had ever been . <sssss> we had a reservation and were seated very promptly by the manager . <sssss> the server also had a slip of paper with our last names and greeted us as such . <sssss> we had two servers , jane and i ca n't remember the guy 's name . <sssss> jane had her spiel down -lrb- as i heard her repeat it to the table behind us -rrb- and was somewhat likeable . <sssss> i found her off-putting at times such as when she acted caught off-guard when i ordered an appetizer as my dinner . <sssss> then she smiled at me in an all-knowing way as if i was one of `` those '' girls ordering something small for dinner . <sssss> i did n't say anything but my husband caught on as he said something about it after she left the table . <sssss> then later i overheard her jokingly ask a gay male couple seated by us `` who is the mrs ? '' <sssss> when presenting their bill . <sssss> that rubbed me wrong way , too , but maybe i was being sensitive . <sssss> anyway , they brought a large warm onion loaf of bread . <sssss> it was okay ... i ate several pieces . <sssss> for dinner , we had the clams casino appetizer -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , for my meal i had the baked prime platter -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , my husband had the cajun ribeye -lrb- $ 47 -rrb- , bacon and onion mac-n-cheese -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- and parmesan truffle fries -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . <sssss> everything was very good except the fries because they never brought it out ! <sssss> it was on the bill , though , so i am not sure what happened there . <sssss> they took it off when we brought it to their attention . <sssss> oh , that reminds me , jane and the other server apologized for the oversight but jane took it one step further by saying that at least it was n't her mistake . <sssss> tacky . <sssss> my baked seafood platter consisted of one breaded large shrimp , one bacon wrapped scallop , one oysters rockerfeller , and one small lump crab cake . <sssss> for $ 22 ????? <sssss> um okay ... the horseradish sauce they gave with it was amazing though . <sssss> my husband was in love with his steak . <sssss> i had a bite , too , and it was really good . <sssss> the mac-n-cheese was very cheesy and decadent . <sssss> for dessert , we had the small chocolate lava cake with a scoop of ice cream -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- . <sssss> i 'm not sure why jane said it took a half hour to cook but either way , it was very delicious . <sssss> adding a couple glasses of wine -lrb- it took awhile for my husband to be asked if he liked a second glass of wine-after his first had been empty for at least 10 minutes -rrb- , our bill came to $ 150 . <sssss> i knew it would be expensive but did n't care because it was a gift to my husband . <sssss> i just do n't get places like this . <sssss> the service was n't better than other places -lrb- and in some instance , worse -rrb- , and the food did n't wow me . <sssss> my husband had a good point that it could be hard to do that with seafood . <sssss> i tend to agree but at that price point and the amount of food , i should have loved it . <sssss> instead , it was comparable to places half the price . <sssss> my husband will probably go back ... but without me . <sssss> meh , not interested .
HIG		i have stopped into copper star on previous occasions , during street festivals , but today was the first time i came to sit and study . <sssss> man , am i a fan of this place . <sssss> i am lucky that i live in a location where i have a multitude of options -lrb- lux , lola , hob nobs , sbux , etc -rrb- but i have to say i really liked the vibe here . <sssss> the music was n't loud , the people relatively quiet and chill , and i could actually focus on what i was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me . <sssss> i liked that while on a busy street -lrb- 7th ave -rrb- , the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on . <sssss> that added to the peace and quiet of it . <sssss> employees were nice , free wi-fi -lrb- internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop -rrb- , and i enjoyed my small , mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie -lrb- both just under $ 7 -rrb- . <sssss> i was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie -lrb- which was soooo good if i might say -rrb- . <sssss> they are open until 9pm on sundays which is pretty cool . <sssss> i have yet to use their drive through for coffee , but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to sbux . <sssss> there is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off ... you can give your dog a bath at wag-n-wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee .
MID		came here a few weeks ago for brunch because of a coupon we had from a playing card deck with restaurant discounts . <sssss> we had never been before but the menu looked delicious . <sssss> we got there pretty much when they opened on a sunday and sat at a table in their `` outside '' patio . <sssss> it is enclosed but very sunny and airy . <sssss> i ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a fried egg on top . <sssss> it was amazing ! <sssss> somehow i managed to eat the entire plate without any hesitation . <sssss> uh , it was so good . <sssss> the balance of sauce and cheese was just perfect and felt light despite that it was enchiladas . <sssss> we ordered the cinnamon roll for my daughter and that was fantastic , too . <sssss> she did n't enjoy it as much as we did , though , but we did n't mind finishing it for her . <sssss> the cream cheese frosting was melt in your mouth yummy . <sssss> i also had a sangria but as i recall , it was just okay . <sssss> but no matter , as we were there to try the food . <sssss> the service was great , too . <sssss> as we were leaving , it began getting packed . <sssss> clear sign that this was the place to be on a sunday morning ...
LOW		i pass this shopping center every day on my way to work and read some great things on yelp . <sssss> one of my best friends is vegetarian so i thought it would be nice for us to try it out . <sssss> we got there around 12:15 yesterday and grabbed the last remaining table . <sssss> we were greeted promptly and had our order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated . <sssss> i ordered the fried spring veggie rolls -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- that were delicious . <sssss> i kept snacking off the fried crispy pieces of the sides . <sssss> for lunch , i had ordered the curry tofu and potatoes -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . <sssss> it came with carrots mixed in the curry sauce with rice and salad . <sssss> i equally enjoyed the salad and curry sauce over the rice . <sssss> i did n't care for the spongy tofu and would have liked more vegetables in the curry rather than just potatoes and carrots . <sssss> this lunch was just okay . <sssss> the service was horrible . <sssss> i did n't get my lunch until 12:50 p.m. . <sssss> the owner was aware of it and apologized but apologies do n't prevent me from getting back to work on time . <sssss> when we were ready to pay , it took forever for him to pick up the check . <sssss> my friend had to flag him down to get his attention . <sssss> very irritating . <sssss> timely service in a restaurant is important to me . <sssss> i would have average food and phenomenal service , as opposed to , phenomal food and terrible service . <sssss> overall , the food was decent/mediocre at times with terrible service . <sssss> it 's doubtful i would go back .
LOW		we got take-out and they were very short-handed . <sssss> it was very busy on a sat night and they only had two servers that also doubled as a hostess . <sssss> what was supposed to take 20 minutes to get our food took 35 minutes . <sssss> we also had to return the food because what was supposed to be a # 1 spicy was actually more like a # 3 . <sssss> my husband , who loves spicy , could n't even eat what was supposed to be the most mild . <sssss> when i went back -lrb- after first calling them 15 minutes before to notify them i was coming in -rrb- , i waited in the lobby for 10 minutes before being acknowledged . <sssss> the lady responded that they were busy and seemed inconvenienced by me . <sssss> i was the one who had to drive back and get my meal remade ! <sssss> i was very disappointed at the response and reluctance to fix the issue . <sssss> the remake of the beef salad was slightly less spicy but at least we could eat it . <sssss> i really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience . <sssss> we also had the fried appetizer sampler that was just okay . <sssss> my husband goes there very frequently and loves this place . <sssss> the portions are very large and prices very reasonable . <sssss> i will go back and hopefully , this one experience was an isolated one .
LOW		do n't let my 3 stars fool you ... i am actually a pretty big fan of this place and look forward to returning . <sssss> i have been twice but the experiences were different , hence the 3 stars . <sssss> the first time i went with my husband and we were seated at one of the community tables . <sssss> they asked us if we were okay with that and it is was fine . <sssss> the more the merrier ! <sssss> i had a glass of their rose wine and ordered their salad that came with avocados , grapefruit , beets , mint , arugula , goat cheese , and a orange vinaigrette . <sssss> i asked them to leave off the grapefruit , beets , and add salami . <sssss> i thoroughly enjoyed it , wow ! <sssss> however , the second time i had it , i ordered it the exact same way -lrb- but for take-out instead -rrb- , and when i ate it , it was way too tart . <sssss> i could barely eat it which stunk because i was really looking forward to having it again . <sssss> other than that , i liked the environment . <sssss> it is really chill , i loved all of the windows which brought alot of light into the restaurant . <sssss> i will definitely go back especially since it has become a fave among my husband and friends .
LOW		we came here for lunch today and what a gorgeous day it was ! <sssss> perfect weather to sit outside in their comfy chairs . <sssss> we started with the fried calamari which is always a must when we go out to eat . <sssss> i am cuckoo for fried calamari but i got ta say i was n't diggin this one . <sssss> neither was my husband . <sssss> it was the calamari steak strips amd was chewy . <sssss> the sauce it came with was good , almost spicy aioli . <sssss> i ordered a philly roll -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- w / avocado which was okay . <sssss> i do n't know why but it tasted bland to me today ... maybe just my tastebuds . <sssss> my husband ordered a roll with halibut , spicy crab and pico de gallo on top -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- . <sssss> i thought it was okay and tasted like ceviche . <sssss> my husband liked that aspect but i am pretty traditional with my ceviche and do not want it in a sushi roll . <sssss> we also split their spicy tuna on crunchy fried rice -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- that i really liked . <sssss> i think that was because the puerto-rican in me liked crunchy rice . <sssss> weird , i know . <sssss> overall , i liked this place but ca n't say it has differentiated itself that i had to come back . <sssss> i am truly ambivalent but could easily stop in if i was shopping in the biltmore . <sssss> it has a very convenient location so you can get your sushi fix after some retail therapy .
HIG		came here last night with the family and despite zero parking in the front , the restaurant was n't too packed . <sssss> finding parking in the front is like trying to spot the loch ness monster ... it ai n't gon na happen . <sssss> but , there is complimentary valet in tne back for lgo patrons , so that is nice . <sssss> anyways , it has been a couple of years since we have been back which is surprising because this is always a fave . <sssss> the pizzas range around $ 13 - $ 14 and you can easily make two meals out of it or feed two people . <sssss> we ordered the half dozen chicken wings as an app , a white sangria for me and a beer for my husband . <sssss> my daughter had a $ 3 pb & j that consisted of 4-5 tiny pb & j `` sushi '' rolls and a rather large pile of french fries for a kids meal . <sssss> i would have liked more of the sandwich than fries but it was only $ 3 so i 'll deal with it . <sssss> i had the padre -lrb- no longer on the menu -rrb- and had it modified to be with blue cheese , prosciutto , and arugula . <sssss> it is a white pizza , so no tomato sauce . <sssss> the crust is a little crusty and chewy ... just the way i like it . <sssss> my husband ordered his favorite , the fallen angel . <sssss> our server was really attentive and very patient with our daughter . <sssss> after dinner , we walked into the grocer next door to satisfy our sweet tooth . <sssss> ooey gooey cookies were to be had -lrb- at $ 2.50 a pop ... yikes ! <sssss> -rrb- and they melted in my mouth , so yummy . <sssss> pizza , wine , and chocolate chip cookies ???? <sssss> now that is what i call the perfect meal .
LOW		my husband is the obsessive pho fan so i am constantly subjected to the pleas of vietnamese take-out . <sssss> we came here the other day for lunch and there were things i liked and did n't . <sssss> we ordered the fried spring rolls -lrb- $ 2.50 , i think -rrb- that were pretty damn good . <sssss> for lunch i ordered the bbq pork bahn-mi -lrb- sp ? <sssss> -rrb- that was $ 2.25 . <sssss> the bread was just the way i like it , soft on the inside , flaky on the outside . <sssss> it was stuffed with bbq pork , cucumber , cilantro , carrots and some other veggies . <sssss> i snagged some of the leftover sprouts from my husband 's pho and put it in my sandwich . <sssss> very good . <sssss> my beefs ? <sssss> half of the meat in my sandwich was all fat . <sssss> i am one of those people that virtually loses my appetite if i chew on something that has fat hanging off the side . <sssss> my husband , who loves the fat , was shocked at how much of the `` meat '' in my sandwich i was giving him . <sssss> i had plenty to eat of what was fast becoming a veggie sandwich but still , that was pretty annoying . <sssss> the last thing i want to do is be picking my food apart in a restaurant . <sssss> my second beef was that not once did they come back to refill our water . <sssss> that was a problem since our food was a little spicy . <sssss> that is n't to say i would n't go back . <sssss> our bill was $ 10 for lunch ... seriously pho thahn ? <sssss> that is damn reasonable and the food is decent enough for me to go back ... for take-out .
MID		a couple of us came here friday and had a good time . <sssss> i liked the off-the beaten path location and the fact that there was no cover . <sssss> they have 2-4-1 drinks 8-10pm , too . <sssss> i thought the music was good and drinks were n't too expensive . <sssss> the thing that almost ruined my time was constantly being bumped by people . <sssss> it is hard to get into the groove when you are being shoved and pushed by people who think they have an entire dance floor to themselves . <sssss> but is n't that every place , though ?
MID		i finally had a chance to try this place out when my husband decided he did n't want to do lunch and bowl at lucky . <sssss> boy , was this place packed ! <sssss> i am glad to see the locals and downtown workers embracing this place . <sssss> inside it has something like a grocery area with drinks , snacks , salads , etc. . <sssss> after ordering at one of the food or coffee counters , you can choose to sit at the counter to eat , or sit in the dining area . <sssss> service was very prompt and attentive . <sssss> i ordered a cheese pizza and triple chocolate cookie . <sssss> my husband had a pastrami and swiss sandwich that looked incredible . <sssss> my pizza was very good as well . <sssss> for all of that and a drink , it seemed pricy at $ 15 . <sssss> especially since the sandwich did n't come with chips or fries , anything . <sssss> i will still go back though as there was alot of dining options here and the food was really good .
MID		i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place as it is my favorite mexican restaurant in north scottsdale . <sssss> i have been here many times for either lunch , happy hour , or dinner . <sssss> every time , service is very attentive and food tasty . <sssss> they have a really good lunch menu and happy hour . <sssss> i consistently get the carnitas street taco meal with 3 tacos and rice . <sssss> their guacamole sol is another favorite made with mango , tomatoes , onions , goat cheese , pepitas . <sssss> fantastic . <sssss> and the chips , salsa , and black bean dip ? <sssss> fugeddaboutit . <sssss> i have had other dishes , some just okay , and others very good . <sssss> the items i love keep me coming back for more ...
LOW		i am so conflicted about my feelings for cherryblossom noodle . <sssss> it 's like the guy or girl you are super attracted to but they have a shitty attitude . <sssss> i wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviews that the food is great but service is inconsistent and mostly bad . <sssss> i was being generous with the 3 stars for this experience but have had higher star experiences in the past . <sssss> just not this weekend . <sssss> we went on saturday night against my husband 's better judgment and at my insistence . <sssss> sorry , babe , i take the blame for this one . <sssss> we go in and the hostess seats us -lrb- two adults and a 2 year old -rrb- . <sssss> five minutes go by and it is apparent that no one is bringing us a high chair . <sssss> my husband had to go ask for one and the hostess -lrb- who sat us -rrb- was like , oh you need a highchair ? <sssss> i suppose my daughter could sit in a regular chair but i envision her falling out , dropping food everywhere , etc. . <sssss> this hostess/server has been there forever and as a matter of fact , we have bad experiences when she has waited on us in the past . <sssss> anyways , we order our food : side of steamed rice , crispy calamari as an appetizer and for dinner , the sushi combo for me , the miso sea bass for my husband . <sssss> we also ordered a large asahi and small , hot sake . <sssss> the drinks came promptly . <sssss> i remember thinking that the calamari app was taking a little while to come out and sure enough , it comes out with my sushi combo and side of rice . <sssss> okay , whatever . <sssss> this does n't bother me too much even though the calamari looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a lamp too long . <sssss> maybe the server forgot it . <sssss> the main issue was that 10 minutes after we got that , we are still waiting on my husband 's dinner . <sssss> seriously ? <sssss> i 'll be honest in that i prefer that the whole dinner be brought out at once so that the table can eat their meals together but hey , i am flexible . <sssss> but 10-15 minutes later , i am almost done with my meal which my husband has been helping me eat since he had n't gotten his . <sssss> the miso sea bass was a special of the night so maybe the restaraunt had alot of orders for it . <sssss> that 's fine but if the kitchen is backed up , it is the server 's responsibility to let us know . <sssss> but , no , the server disappeared after dropping off the food and never came back . <sssss> he only came back after my husband walked up to the front to cancel the entree to apologize and see if we wanted dessert . <sssss> um , no , not having anything else . <sssss> about 5 minutes after that , the hostess dropped off our check and again , we waited awhile and still no server came to get the check . <sssss> so , my husband went up to the front to drop off the card . <sssss> then the manager dropped off the receipt , not the server . <sssss> terrible , terrible , service . <sssss> it is such a shame , because i love going to cherryblossom . <sssss> the sushi combo -lrb- choice of two rolls , with miso soup and salad for $ 11 -rrb- is a great deal and mostly everything i have gotten there is very good . <sssss> i also love the mixed bread basket with dinner rolls , cinnamon toast and banana bread . <sssss> but it is n't worth the crappy service . <sssss> beware , too , if you do take-out , they try to avoid giving the you the soup , salad , and bread that would normally come with your meal . <sssss> they tried telling my husband that they do n't give that for take-out . <sssss> um , unless they are discounting the take-out food -lrb- which they are not -rrb- , they should be giving everything that would normally come with the meal . <sssss> sigh , i hope this place gets their act together ...
MID		we finally came tonight after the husband has been wanting to go forever . <sssss> i have been here once before but both locations -lrb- tempe and westgate -rrb- always seem impossibly far from our cenpho home . <sssss> i do n't want to work that hard for some sushi and usually only go if in the area . <sssss> this location is in tempe marketplace so you can mix sake bombers with a little blurry retail therapy after . <sssss> i had joined their kabuki club and they frequently send me coupons for various occasions -lrb- family birthdays , anniversary , monthly specials -rrb- . <sssss> the menu is typical of most japanese spots but there is also a lot of variety . <sssss> for apps , we had the fried calamari and the garlic edamame . <sssss> i usually only have regular edamame -lrb- which they bring out complimentary -rrb- but the garlic ones were addicting ... i was literally licking the oil off my fingers and scrounging for the diced garlic in the bowl . <sssss> i only stopped when the server came by to check . <sssss> i am such a garlic junkie . <sssss> i was n't so much a fan of the thick batter on the calamari but the wasabi sauce it came with was really good . <sssss> not very spicy but with a nice kick . <sssss> i had the philly roll -lrb- $ 5.25 -rrb- and the jumbo volcano app -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- that was crab , avocado and spicy tuna baked with a little eel sauce on the top . <sssss> i would definitely have that again . <sssss> unfortunately , i could n't eat more of the jumbo volcano because i gorged myself on the apps . <sssss> we took the chocolate mousse dessert home -lrb- used our complimentary dessert coupon -rrb- . <sssss> it had fruit on the side and was filled with white chocolate . <sssss> i could have eaten that one for days and was foiled when my husband decided to eat half ... curses !! <sssss> anyways , i like the atmosphere and i think the prices are average . <sssss> it looks like they also have reverse happy hour which is always a plus in my book !
MID		while the first time i came here was a solid 3 stars , the second time was very enjoyable . <sssss> this time i ordered the cheese board and just like the last time , there were like 3 cheeses , pistachios , another kind of nut , jam , bread , etc. . <sssss> very good and plentiful . <sssss> last time , we ordered the warm mixed nuts that were really good but i could n't eat too much of it . <sssss> my husband ordered this pork dish that had hominy , and i do n't remember what else but it was freakin awesome . <sssss> i kept eating out of his skillet . <sssss> yum . <sssss> my $ 10 specialty cocktail was knock me on my ass strong but good . <sssss> i gave it to my husband after while because i would have been drunk just off the one . <sssss> i guess that is a good problem to have . <sssss> the service was top-notch . <sssss> she was just the right amount of attentive and did a great job . <sssss> the decor was bright and modern . <sssss> i really enjoyed this last experience .
LOW		i am really conflicted about lustre bar . <sssss> it is an outdoor bar located on the second floor of the hotel -lrb- where the pool is -rrb- . <sssss> it is beautiful with plenty of comfortable seating throughout . <sssss> the views are stunning . <sssss> the drinks are expensive at $ 10 a pop . <sssss> they are handcrafted cocktails -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- but i often feel they are too strong for me . <sssss> on one hand , that is probably good because at $ 10 , you wo n't need to drink many . <sssss> but i want to enjoy my drinks , so i do n't know . <sssss> you can also order food while you are up there , from the blue hound kitchen , which is cool . <sssss> keep in mind , though , that it is a limited menu . <sssss> we came for the nye party and that was a bit of a train wreck : the good : cover charge was reasonable at $ 20 . <sssss> the music was great and there was n't one particular genre , so there was something for everyone . <sssss> there was a complimentary buffet of light items . <sssss> the bad : there was n't enough heat lamps so groups of people were often huddled under them and i even saw people with blankets . <sssss> really ????? <sssss> service was horrendous and absent . <sssss> there were only 3 girls working the grounds and at point i ordered a drink from our waitress and we did n't see her for 45 minutes . <sssss> plus , i never got the drink i ordered from her . <sssss> at one point , she sniped at us that she was really busy and never came back . <sssss> i spoke with an employee about it and he handled it . <sssss> if we wanted to go to the bar instead , that was a half hour wait to get a drink . <sssss> it was awful . <sssss> i was really surprised at how little staffed this nye party was . <sssss> again , overall , i am conflicted about how i feel about lustre bar . <sssss> i think it still has some growing pains .
MID		be flexible when you come here because there might be a really long wait if you do n't have a reservation -lrb- accepted for groups 4 or more -rrb- . <sssss> the food is a bit pricey -lrb- spent $ 83 the other day for 2 adults and a child -rrb- . <sssss> despite this , i really love the new mexican cuisine and flavors , although more often than not , the food is a little too spicy for me . <sssss> my favorites are their bacon wrapped shrimp and roasted garlic plate . <sssss> fair warning that the menu is very similar to richardsons . <sssss> the other day , i ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp -lrb- 5 for $ 16 -rrb- and thought it was the dinner . <sssss> the server told me i was confusing it with richardson 's and that at rokerij , it was an app . <sssss> parking is valet , of course , which is a little annoying but standard in central phoenix .
LOW		i live in the area and i have been very interested in trying this out . <sssss> they have also certificates on restaurant.com but i did not purchase one . <sssss> i definitely have my favorite coffee shops but i am always open to adding another one to the list . <sssss> i took my daughter with me , along with some children 's books to read on a rainy , az day . <sssss> i got myself an sugar-free vanilla nonfat latte and my daughter a kids hot chocolate . <sssss> i had to repeat my latte order like 3 times to the male employee and after i got it , waited for it to cool down and took a sip , i realized they never added the syrup . <sssss> pretty annoying given how many times i had to remind the guy what i ordered as he rung me up . <sssss> the lady who made my daughter 's hot chocolate added whipped cream and chocolate syrup and did n't make it too hot , which i really appreciated . <sssss> my daughter still ended up spilling it on her white shirt . <sssss> what i was thinking ???? <sssss> a 3 year old , hot chocolate and a white shirt ?? <sssss> aahhh , the never-ending lessons of a new mom . <sssss> since i forgot to bring a snack for my daughter , i ordered a blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate chip cookie for me . <sssss> both were extremely good . <sssss> the total for the drinks and food were just under $ 9 which i think is standard . <sssss> as i looked in the display case , at the food , there was a pretty good variety . <sssss> as other reviewers mentioned , the chairs are mismatched throughout . <sssss> i found a table with a comfy chair -lrb- all of the other chairs were the standard , hard , wooden -rrb- since i planned to have my daughter in my lap as we read . <sssss> overall , i would say i enoyed my time here -lrb- besides the drink mistake -rrb- . <sssss> i wish they had some arm chairs or couches or something but maybe they will in the future . <sssss> there were alot of people here so u.b. seemed to be popular . <sssss> i 'm not sure if i would come back but maybe . <sssss> i 'm intrigued by the byob and the variety of events they have .
MID		came here last night after quickly convincing the hubby we should eat out and not stay in . <sssss> we have heard lots of good things about this place and i am pleased to say it is as good as people say . <sssss> we were seated on the patio -lrb- a good option for a rowdy 3 year old -rrb- and were promptly given water . <sssss> i ordered the tres amigos margarita special of the night -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- and liked it . <sssss> next time , i 'll have to try the rasberry -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- or pomegranate margarita -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . <sssss> hubby got the mojito and it was decent . <sssss> they were also doing free tequila tastings of tres amigos blanco , anejo and i ca n't remember the third . <sssss> i really enjoyed that as anytime i am typically having tequila , i am not exactly concerned with the tastings differences in each blend . <sssss> so , i learned something new this time . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> the menu looks really great and i look forward to trying new dishes here . <sssss> i had the salmon and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and vegetables . <sssss> the rice was moist and delicious and reminded me a lot of the rice i grew up eating with puerto-rican dishes . <sssss> the veggies were my favorites : red onions , and green and yellow squash . <sssss> the enchiladas were pretty good but i would probably not order them again . <sssss> i am more of a traditional enchilada type of girl and as much as i love salmon , i guess i do n't prefer it in my enchiladas . <sssss> but that is no fault to padres as the dish was very good . <sssss> my husband ordered their steak and unfortunately , his medium rare steak came out well done . <sssss> they fixed it but hubby was very annoyed that i was pretty much finished with my plate when his remake came out . <sssss> the server was great even though he forgot my daughter 's drink and ordered her a cheese quesadilla appetizer and not the kids cheese quesadilla . <sssss> but other than that , he consistently checked on us , was knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the menu and told us we should come back for salsa nights . <sssss> on friday and sat nights , they do salsa dancing and bring in a band . <sssss> i ca n't wait to go for that with some girlfriends . <sssss> fri it is 8:30 -11:30 pm and sat it is 8-11pm .
MID		i recently took my daughter here for dinner and we had a really nice meal . <sssss> as expected , it was packed on a friday night , but we did n't wait long for a table . <sssss> the kids meals are free and my daughter had the cheese pizza with a side salad . <sssss> i ordered the pork chile verde , goat cheese app , and a side of polenta . <sssss> i also had 2 cocktails and since it was happy hour , everything was relatively inexpensive . <sssss> before we left , i ordered the pork belly risotto for my husband and everything came out to $ 45 . <sssss> very reasonable . <sssss> service was attentive , too , and humored my daughter with all of her 6 yr old ramblings and questions . <sssss> we really enjoyed ourselves !
LOW		came here for nye dinner and i was relieved there was n't a prixe fix menu like every other restaurant in downtown phoenix . <sssss> this was my first time here and i was pretty impressed with the size and decor . <sssss> for some reason i was expecting something more casual but it was very nicely decorated and upscale . <sssss> our server was very attentive and friendly even with the place being packed . <sssss> i ordered a martini and a margherita pizza . <sssss> my drink was good but i was very disappointed in the pizza . <sssss> the crust and dough were very limp and cheese too thick . <sssss> when i took a bite , almost all of the cheese on the slice tried to come with it because it was so thick . <sssss> i had some of my husband 's pizza which was only slightly better . <sssss> the dough was just too limp and not what i would expect from this place . <sssss> maybe little caesers . <sssss> i want to go back though and give it another shot ...
MID		i just love farmer 's markets and being able to try lots of different local things . <sssss> today , we stopped by on a yelp shops local crawl and i immediately diverted to several stands . <sssss> various items i scooped up today included 2 large soft pretzels , cheese curds , avocado and garlic oil , and a spicy filipino marinade at lil rosie 's . <sssss> very nice farmer 's market .
LOW		we decided to eat here while at the moon festival sat night . <sssss> i was a little embarrassed that we had a stroller with us but they did n't bat an eye . <sssss> they showed us where to put it and we were good to go . <sssss> my husband and i each had a tsing tao -lrb- i 'm sure i mispelled that -rrb- , and split an order of crab rangoon , sweet and sour chicken and rice noodles with beef . <sssss> everything was decent although not enough to distinguish itself from other chinese restaurants . <sssss> service was great and prices were extremely reasonable . <sssss> my fave was the rice noodles with beef because it had lots of onions , sprouts and other veggies in it . <sssss> a little salty for my liking but i liked it nonetheless . <sssss> i am indifferent if i were to go back . <sssss> apparently you can find certificates on restaurant.com which is cool , too . <sssss> they also bring you soft , almond cookies with the bill which is always a nice treat !
LOW		i used to love this place but now we go more out of habit . <sssss> we got take-out there the other night for a light meal and managed to spend $ 30 on a regular spicy tuna roll , a specialty roll and side of steamed rice . <sssss> $ 30 seriously ? <sssss> and the specialty roll was only 6 pieces which was disappointing given the cost . <sssss> looks like hana is starting to cut back with prices staying steady or increasing . <sssss> a sign in the front alerts patrons who want to split checks that there will be a $ 1.50 charge on each bill `` given the recent economy . '' <sssss> i find that pretty unbelievable . <sssss> anyways , the food is generally pretty good . <sssss> one of my favorites is their hana salad although i was pretty disappointed when they began layering the bottom of the salad with iceberg lettuce instead of the usual mix . <sssss> again with the cut-backs . <sssss> do n't get me wrong . <sssss> i like hana alot but i think they are becoming overpriced for food that is good but in an average way comparable to other asian spots .
HIG		i 'll admit , it has been many years since i have had an actual meal here . <sssss> the only reason i come is for the to die for cheesecake . <sssss> it used to be that i would typically get the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake , which by the way , is sinful . <sssss> well , i guess they all are . <sssss> it has an oreo crust , chocolate chips throughout and on the top , and a generous dollop of whipped cream on the side . <sssss> then they introduced the red velvet cake cheesecake and i 'm like , seriously , cheesecake factory ? <sssss> it has a moist , red velvet cake surrounded by layers of cheesecake . <sssss> it also has a cream cheese frosting with what tastes like white chocolate shavings in the frosting . <sssss> i came here yesterday with the excuse of validating my parking token -lrb- as my husband puts it , yeah right ! <sssss> -rrb- . <sssss> i got the cookie dough slice and then i noticed the red velvet which i thought was just a limited time . <sssss> so what was an indecisive girl to do but get both slices . <sssss> $ 16 later -lrb- yikes ! <sssss> -rrb- but i am the happiest girl in the world .
MID		the husband took me here on date night , last night , as he keeps saying it is one of his favorite bars downtown . <sssss> he kept raving about how nice the decor was inside , and i thought , `` great , another potentially pretentious upscale bar . '' <sssss> i will say it can give off that vibe but i thought the bar was really nice . <sssss> it is on the corner of adams and 1st st , i think , so if you are sitting at the tables by the windows , there is plenty of people watching to be seen . <sssss> we sat at the bar and it was busy when we got there around 10:30 pm . <sssss> it quickly died out , though . <sssss> the music was really good with alot of 80 's r & b / pop but with beats mixed to it . <sssss> i had a malibu and cranberry , hubby had 2 vodka tonics -lrb- smirnoff -rrb- , and we split one of their snack plates since we already had dinner . <sssss> in the middle of the bar is one of those deli slicers with prosciutto and a block of parmesan next to it . <sssss> the snack plate consisted of some bread , salami , prosciutto , two kinds of olives , roasted pistachios , and slices of parmesan . <sssss> my kind of snack !! <sssss> to my shock , our bill was only $ 24 -lrb- with tax -rrb- . <sssss> my drink was $ 7 , the vodka tonics were $ 5 each and the snack plate was $ 5 . <sssss> i was very surprised at how reasonable those prices were . <sssss> i suppose given the decor , i was expecting to be charged more so it was a good surprise . <sssss> especially for that snack plate where i have paid close to $ 10 for something similar . <sssss> i ca n't wait to return !
